# Bristlenose — Where I Left Off

Last updated: 19 May 2026 (`release-pipeline-actually-broken` shipped as PR #109, merged `b254dde`. PyPI was stuck at v0.15.3 for 8 days — six tag pushes (0.15.4-0.15.10) reached GitHub but `ci/perf-gate` failed on every one, blocking `release.yml`'s publish job. Root cause: the v0.15.4-era status-page interceptor returns "Nothing to see here, yet." when `app.state.last_run[1]` has no terminus event, and the Playwright smoke fixture had never carried `pipeline-events.jsonl`. Fix is test-only — `tests/`, `e2e/`, fixture data, plus CLAUDE.md release-flow doc edit. No version bump; wheel is byte-identical, v0.15.10 tag will be force-moved to the merge SHA post-9pm tonight via the scheduled `trig_01HbgHubvbVKTutgiuvm75EL` remote agent. Three structural layers landed so the next silent-mount regression fails loudly: pytest `TestSmokeFixtureMountsSPA`, Playwright `spa-mounts.spec.ts`, browser-console capture in `perf-gate.spec.ts`. CLAUDE.md release-timing section now ends in a PyPI verification poll loop — pushing a tag is not the same as shipping a release.)

**Earlier 17 May 2026:** C1 codebook plumbing shipped from cloud session as PR #107, merge `bf714bf`, bump to v0.15.10 — `--codebook=<slug>` flag on `run`/`analyze` + `bristlenose codebooks` subcommand. Validation only; consumer wiring is follow-up. Three review agents fanned out (code, Bach, Ockham); Rich-markup-eating gotcha future-proofed at the interpolation site even though no current YAML triggers it. 11 new tests, 2681 in full suite, ruff clean. v0.15.10 tag created at `bf714bf` but the release pipeline didn't publish — see entry above.

**Most recent ship: v0.15.4 (10 May 2026)** — Browser SPA refreshes within ~3 s of pipeline completion (no more "drop folder → nothing happens until you reload"); refresh button + refetch overlay + post-zero-quotes empty-state copy; Export downloads route via `WKDownload` + `NSSavePanel` under App Sandbox (HTML report path; other export surfaces tracked in follow-up); failure pill on desktop now renders the structured `Cause` category from the events log instead of a generic "Failed" badge. See `CHANGELOG.md` for full bullet list.

**Launch plan:** `docs/private/100days.md` — triaged by topic + MoSCoW priority. That's the source of truth for what ships. This file is a public capture inbox + session context + done history.

## Next session focus

**Mission Sandbox PASSED 4 May 2026.** Alpha-checkpoint #3 cleared end-to-end; #14 (bf2533a) + #15 (f2162a9) landed direct-on-main. TestFlight is now gated only on **Track B + S6**.

Pick up from `docs/private/100days.md` and `docs/private/sprint2-tracks.md` — Track B (MVP UX) and S6 are the remaining alpha gates. No active sandbox triage.

Open follow-ups not in any active branch (surface separately, not alpha blockers):
- **Sidebar drag-and-drop polish chips** (14 May 2026, gruber pass on commit `fce69e4`) — three small UX/correctness items deferred after the `.dropDestination` refactor: (1) **Folder row should accept Finder URL drops directly** — currently a Finder folder dropped onto a `FolderRow` bubbles up to the List's URL drop and creates a top-level project, ignoring the folder under the cursor. Either consume silently or, better, create the project *inside* the folder (requires threading `intoFolder: UUID?` through `processDroppedURLs` / `addProject`). Real UX bug — visible. (2) **Replace String-typed internal-project payload with a custom `Transferable` newtype** — `.draggable(project.id.uuidString)` + `.dropDestination(for: String.self)` works but is type-weak; a `ProjectDragID: Codable, Transferable` with a custom UTType (`app.bristlenose.project-id`) would be the idiomatic version and would also close the snag in (1) by making the folder row's two drop types non-overlapping. (3) **Drop-affordance accessibility** — `.dropDestination` provides no VoiceOver announcement; add `.accessibilityLabel` overload or `.accessibilityHint("Drop interview files here to add")` on `ProjectRow`. Confirm the existing "Move to" menu item (CLAUDE.md line 359, `moveSelectedProject` notification) is wired and keyboard-reachable as the keyboard alternative for the project→folder drag gesture.
- **`proc_listpids` EPERM** — zombie cleanup non-functional under sandbox. Deferred post-alpha (triaged).
- **IOKit AppleNVMeEANUC deny** — silent, single occurrence per launch. Investigate only if it surfaces user-visibly.
- ~~**frontend size-limit fails on `main` by 547 B**~~ ✅ **Resolved 14 May 2026** — bumped budget to 215 kB (was 210 kB) to re-baseline against Node 24 gzip output. Runtime currency / security / dep coherence outweighs sub-1% size headroom; the right fix when a version bump trips a size gate by < a few kB is to raise the budget, not lower the runtime. `frontend/CLAUDE.md` reflects the new ceiling.
- ~~**`test_subprocess_sigterm_writes_run_cancelled` flakes on Ubuntu Python 3.10 + 3.11**~~ ✅ **Defended 19 May 2026** — post-signal `_wait_for_event` deadline bumped 30s → 60s → 120s through the `release-pipeline-actually-broken` cycle. 60s wasn't enough on 3.12 ubuntu under a 590s full-suite run; 120s holds. Defensive only — the wait is monotonic against runner load. Eventual refactor: replace the subprocess's `time.sleep(60)` body with an event-driven start signal so the test doesn't park on a long sleep at all. Post-release scope.

### A3 cli-honest-output follow-ups (parked, see review log)

Status: A3 landed on `main` 14 May 2026 as commits `dc71073` (code+tests+Swift), `607202d` (user-facing docs), `04dcdd6` (design-doc sweep). Review log: `docs/private/reviews/cli-improvements.md` — 30 findings, 15 resolved / 7 parked / 8 ignored.

Parked items most likely to resurface during cohort calls (in priority order):
- **Failure-banner copy in manual.md** (Finding 22) — new banners aren't documented anywhere user-readable. Manual.html is the natural Google landing for "bristlenose claude api key invalid". 3–5 bullet "When things go wrong" section. Pairs with Finding 25 (doctor positioning) and Finding 24 (run/serve mental-model one-liner).
- **AUTH suffix edge cases** (Finding 14) — `(no key set)` / `(key too short)` alternate diagnostic when key is missing/typo'd. Surfaces if a tester hits "rejected" with no suffix and asks why.
- **Abandon-path verbosity** (Finding 7, parked Chesterton) — surface partial-run stats on mid-run DISK / MISSING_BINARY via a `--verbose` flag on `run` if cohort asks.

### cli-just-works follow-ups (deferred from cli-just-works branch — see Decisions block at `.claude/plans/cli-just-works.md`)

- **No-account-yet flow** — numbered URL → getpass → optional Keychain persist → re-enter validation. Existing `_maybe_prompt_for_provider` covers the simpler "missing-key → prompt" case; full-numbered flow defers to a follow-up branch. Spec lives in the Decisions block.
- **`pipeline-events.jsonl` `Cause` entries on preflight aborts** (finding 12 in design doc) — currently aborts go through `typer.Exit(2)` with the recovery message; threading the event writer through the preflight modules is its own small refactor.
- **Verify quarterly-drift cron `trig_01BtVXKG5hBnhPF4bGwR78CR` is armed** against current `billing_hints.py` URLs/minimums. Verification task, not code.
- **Translation review** for `bristlenose/locales/{es,fr,de,ko,ja}/preflight.json` — currently English mirrors. Picks up the parked product-polish text rewrites (Findings 12, 13, 14, 45, 49 in the review log) at the same time so translators see the final English shape once, not twice.

## Desktop app security (must-fix before any distribution)

From security review of desktop app plan (22 Mar 2026). All findings are in the serve-side and process management layer, not the Swift bridge code (which is clean).

- [x] **Localhost auth token** — bearer token middleware, per-session `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`, validated on `/api/*` + `/media/*`. Injected into HTML (`json.dumps`) + WKUserScript (regex-validated). Design: `docs/design-localhost-auth.md`
- [x] **Media endpoint filtering** — extension allowlist + path-traversal guard on `/media/` route. Also requires auth token
- [x] **CORS middleware** — `CORSMiddleware(allow_origins=[])` blocks all cross-origin requests
- [x] **Don't bundle API key in binary** — verified clean: no hardcoded keys in Swift source, Keychain-only storage, user enters via Settings
- [x] **Skip zombie cleanup when dev port override is set** — `killOrphanedServeProcesses()` now skips when the external-server env var is active, so the terminal dev server isn't killed on Xcode launch. (Env var renamed from `BRISTLENOSE_DEV_PORT` to `BRISTLENOSE_DEV_EXTERNAL_PORT` in Track C C1.)
- [x] **Minimal child process environment** — stripped to PATH, HOME, TMPDIR, USER, SHELL, locale, VIRTUAL_ENV + BRISTLENOSE_* overlay in `ServeManager.overlayPreferences()`

Remaining security items tracked in `docs/private/100days.md` §6 Risk.

## Desktop app — shipped this session

- [x] **Video player popout (WKUIDelegate)** — `window.open()` now creates a native NSWindow with WKWebView for player.html. Dynamic title (`s1 — Bristlenose`), `setFrameAutosaveName` for position persistence, single-popout guard, `webViewDidClose` cleanup
- [x] **12 video menu actions wired** — playPause, skip±5/±30, speed up/down/normal, volume up/down/mute, PiP, fullscreen. `sendCommand` on PlayerContext → `bristlenose-command` postMessage → player.html
- [x] **Bridge player state** — `getState()` reports live `hasPlayer`/`playerPlaying` for Video menu dimming. `postPlayerState` notifies Swift on open/close/play/pause
- [x] **Security hardening** — origin validation on postMessage (both directions), payload namespacing, float rounding on speed/volume steps, no-video guard
- [x] **BroadcastChannel fallback** — defence-in-depth for glow sync if `window.opener` is nil in WKWebView popouts
- [x] **a11y announce** — `announce("Playing pid")` on seekTo for VoiceOver

## Desktop app — bugs found

- [x] **Native toolbar tabs don't navigate** — fixed: stale `navigate` closure in `installNavigationShims`. Module-level refs instead of direct closure capture. Also added `makeFirstResponder(webView)` after tab switch for keyboard focus
- [x] **i18n: extract ~200 hardcoded frontend strings** — done (24 Mar 2026). ~30 components wired with `useTranslation()`. Sentiment badges translate via `enums.json`. `format.ts` uses `Intl.DateTimeFormat`. `<html lang>` tracks locale. Screen reader `announce()` calls use `i18n.t()`. Keys in all 5 locale files (en/es/fr/de/ko)
- [x] **i18n: help prose + shortcuts (Batch 11)** — HelpSection and ShortcutsSection wired to `t()` with `help.guide.*` and `help.shortcuts.*` keys (24 Mar 2026). SignalsSection, CodebookSection, ContributingSection also wired (24 Mar). AboutSection, DeveloperSection, DesignSection remain hardcoded English — deferred as "Could" in 100days.md
- [x] **i18n: Weblate setup** — connect `hosted.weblate.org` to repo for community translation. Free Libre plan. See `docs/design-i18n.md`
- [→] **i18n: Settings second-pane sweep + menu-bar audit** — folded 8 May 2026 into `docs/private/100days.md` §2 Should as a single [Beta-must] entry covering all three (LLM detail pane / Transcription pane / menu-bar audit). Full file:line context preserved in 100days entry. Removed from TODO.md per "antechamber not duplicate" rule.

Remaining desktop bugs and i18n items tracked in `docs/private/100days.md` §2, §7, §8.

## Desktop app — multi-project sidebar Phase 1 (26 Mar 2026)

- [x] **ProjectIndex model** — `projects.json` in `~/Library/Application Support/Bristlenose/`. CRUD with unique name enforcement (appends " 2", " 3"). New projects insert at top
- [x] **ProjectRow with inline rename** — `doc.text` icon, slow-double-click rename (0.3–1.0s), `simultaneousGesture` so List selection isn't swallowed. Commit on Return, cancel on Escape
- [x] **Sidebar layout** — "Projects" section header, `+ New Project…` row at top of list, `folder.badge.plus` button in sidebar title bar (disabled, Phase 3 placeholder). Selection by UUID (not value type) survives project mutations
- [x] **Project menu rewired** — Show in Finder (native `NSWorkspace`), Rename/Delete via notifications. Re-Analyse/Archive disabled (future). File > New Project (Cmd+N) posts notification
- [x] **BridgeHandler.selectedProjectPath** — published property for menu disable guards, reset on project switch

- [x] **Phase 3: Folders** — `FolderRow.swift`, `Folder` model with CRUD, `folderId` on Project, `SidebarSelection` enum, `DisclosureGroup` collapse, "Move to" submenu, adaptive Project menu, File > New Folder (⇧⌘N), `folder.badge.plus` enabled, collapsed state persistence, locale keys in all 6 languages

Remaining multi-project work tracked in `.claude/plans/tf-multi-project.md` (Phase 0 + Phase 1 shipped 14 May 2026; Phase 2 sidecar-restart switch (#1/#2/#3) shipped 14 May 2026 on `multi-project-switch`; Phase 2 #11 drag-onto-existing shipped 15 May 2026 on `multi-project-drag-onto`; Phase 2 #14 folder watcher still open; Phase 3 cloud-evicted post-cohort). Original 5-phase plan in `docs/design-project-sidebar.md` is superseded for TF scope.

## CI hardening — sprint 2 step 0 (18 Apr 2026, ci-cleanup branch)

- [x] **Flip e2e gate to blocking** — removed `continue-on-error: true` from `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. First CI run post-flip passed green (19m44s). The three P3 regressions parked during v0.14.5 release-unblock are cleared: autocode status 404 allowlisted (REST-correct), codebook route 404 allowlisted as deferred-fix (root cause S3), `_BRISTLENOSE_AUTH_TOKEN=test-token` wired into the main e2e workflow
- [x] **`e2e/ALLOWLIST.md` register** — every deliberate e2e-spec suppression now has a categorised entry + `// ci-allowlist: CI-A<N>` code marker. 3 categories: infra / by-design / deferred-fix. 4 current entries. Prevents silent accretion. Validator + staleness gate deferred to v2 (tracked §11)
- [x] **SECURITY.md auth-token honesty update** — prior text claimed the token was random-at-startup and memory-only unconditionally; reality is `_BRISTLENOSE_AUTH_TOKEN` in env overrides (for CI fixtures + uvicorn reload). Spec now matches code; doctor check warns on accidental env bleed. The proper gate (behind `BRISTLENOSE_DEV_MODE=test`) is a design problem deferred with a full plan (reminder 16 May 2026)
- [x] **Fix: Analysis "Show all N quotes" toggle** — was an `<a>` without `href` (surfaced only when e2e gate became blocking). Converted to `<button type="button">` with minimal CSS reset
- [x] **Fix: `playwright.config.ts` shell-quoting** — unquoted `${BRISTLENOSE}` / `${FIXTURE_DIR}` interpolation broke worktrees with spaces in the name. Pre-existing; surfaced during ci-cleanup verification

## CI hardening — sprint 1 (15–16 Apr 2026)

- [x] **pytest coverage in CI** — `--cov` flags on pytest, coverage XML uploaded as artifact, `[tool.coverage]` config in `pyproject.toml`. Baseline: 73% (11,116 statements). No `fail_under` yet — informational
- [x] **macOS CI matrix** — `ubuntu-latest` + `macos-latest` (informational, `continue-on-error`). Catches platform-specific bugs without blocking merges
- [x] **GZip middleware** — `GZipMiddleware(minimum_size=500)` on FastAPI app. Media routes set `Content-Encoding: identity` to prevent re-compression of video/audio
- [x] **Frontend bundle size gate** — `size-limit` (300 kB gzipped JS), `npm run size` / `npm run size:why`, runs in CI after frontend build
- [x] **Alembic migration strategy** — replaces manual `_migrate_schema()` with programmatic Alembic (no `alembic.ini`). Per-project SQLite, `render_as_batch=True` for SQLite compat, detect-and-stamp for existing DBs. Baseline revision 001 (no-op). 9 migration tests. Unblocks Person UUID migration (S3)
- [x] **Multi-Python CI** — test matrix expanded to 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 × 2 OS (8 cells). `fail-fast: false`, macOS informational
- [x] **Split lint from test jobs** — `lint` (ruff, mypy, man page, pip-audit, SBOM) runs once on ubuntu/3.12. `test` matrix `needs: lint` — universal failures skip all 8 test jobs
- [x] **pip cache on test runners** — `cache: pip` on `setup-python` saves 30-60s per job
- [x] **Single coverage artifact** — only ubuntu/3.12 uploads coverage XML (was 8 redundant uploads)
- [x] **CI architecture doc** — `docs/design-ci.md`: goals, philosophy, job structure, matrix strategy, coverage gaps audit, desktop-build plan

## PII redaction audit (26 Mar 2026)

- [x] **Bug: Word objects not cleared after redaction** — `model_copy()` replaced `seg.text` but `seg.words` still contained original PII. Fixed in `s07_pii_removal.py`
- [x] **Bug: `pii_summary.txt` was a re-identification key in shareable output** — moved to `.bristlenose/` hidden directory with CONFIDENTIAL header
- [x] **Bug: `__repr__` leaked original PII into logs** — now shows `<N chars>` instead
- [x] **Bug: `UK_NHS` in entity map but not in `_DEFAULT_ENTITIES`** — one-line fix
- [x] **Config: `pii_score_threshold`** — configurable via `BRISTLENOSE_PII_SCORE_THRESHOLD` (0.0–1.0, default 0.7). Wired into `_redact_text()`
- [x] **Runtime warnings for dead config fields** — `pii_llm_pass` and `pii_custom_names` warn when set but not implemented
- [x] **Horror-show test transcript** — fictional adversarial interview with 70+ planted PII items across 8 categories. `tests/fixtures/pii_horror_transcript.txt` + `pii_horror_expected.yaml`
- [x] **PII audit test suite** — `tests/test_pii_audit.py` — 12 CI-safe tests + 70 parametrised Presidio detection tests (`@pytest.mark.slow`)
- [x] **Privacy help section** — new "Privacy" section in HelpModal (between Codebook and About). 3 subsections: where data goes, PII redaction limits, what to do. Links to published audit artifacts on GitHub. All 5 locales
- [x] **SECURITY.md overhaul** — PII section expanded with catches/misses/cannot-detect subsections, speaker ID timing, audit trail location
- [x] **PII audit artifacts** — `docs/pii-audit/` with README, redacted transcript, and summary log. Linked from help panel

Remaining PII work tracked in `docs/private/100days.md` §4 Value (PII dashboard widget) and §6 Risk.

## Re-evaluate security-review agent calibration (29 Apr 2026)

AI makes it cheap to enumerate every "could go wrong" — that doesn't mean every finding is worth acting on. During Beat 3 QA setup, security-review returned 11 findings against a single QA doc; piping them verbatim (rotate test keys, dedicated $5-cap key, Logger privacy spot-check, quit Zoom/iCloud before Wi-Fi off, wipe keychain via shell) added theatre without proportional risk reduction for a dev Mac with $20-cap + no-auto-renew keys. User pushback ("if they get my mac and cut my thumb off they can have the keychain — what do i care about $20 in a log") was the right calibration check.

Agent-side fixes to evaluate:
- Have the agent lead each finding with realistic impact + cost-of-mitigation, not adversarial scenario. Proportionality as burden of proof.
- Self-classify findings as "ship blocker" / "code-quality nice" / "threat-model dependent" instead of flat severity.
- Inject the user's threat model (single-user dev Mac, capped keys, security-literate ex-Canonical) so the agent weighs against actual consequence.

Caller-side discipline already captured in `feedback_proportionate_security.md` and the index entry in `MEMORY.md` — don't pipe agent output verbatim, mediate.

Bigger question: same calibration likely applies to other adversarial-by-design agents (a11y-review, perf-review). Worth tuning the suite prompts together.

## Local AI (Ollama) — set expectations on quality + perf (3 May 2026)

- [→] **Ollama setup sheet quality + perf expectations copy** — folded 8 May 2026 into `docs/private/100days.md` §2 Broken Must as `[S3] **Ollama setup quality + perf expectations copy**`. Removed from TODO.md per "antechamber not duplicate" rule.
- [ ] **Collab with [`llmfit`](https://github.com/AlexsJones/llmfit)** for "what local model should this hardware run?" — currently `OllamaCatalog.fits()` is a hand-rolled approximation: bundled curated list + memory thresholds + "recommended for this Mac" hint. `llmfit`'s whole job is that question. Two scopes: (a) reuse llmfit as a dependency to power the model picker (replace the curated list + hint logic), (b) closer collab — contribute Bristlenose's actual analysis-task profiles (long-context theme clustering, structured quote extraction) so llmfit's "fit" metric incorporates analysis quality, not just "will it load." Reach out to AlexsJones once we have a story to tell (post-alpha, when we have real user-machine data on what actually works for analysis runs vs just chat). Captured 3 May 2026 during sandbox-debug walk.

## OllamaSetupSheet — confirmation when daemon + model already present (4 May 2026)

When `OllamaSetupModel.run()` finds the daemon already reachable AND the chosen model already pulled (common on a re-test, or a user who already had Ollama installed), the sheet flips straight from `.idle` → `.finishing` in a few hundred ms. AIConsentView dismisses, user lands on WelcomeView, and there's **no signal that anything actually happened**. The user has to trust that "Set up" did its job.

Options to consider (don't bikeshed in this entry — pick one when it surfaces):
- Brief success state (`.completed` phase before `.finishing`) showing "Ollama is set up — using Gemma 4 E4B" for 1.5–2s before auto-dismiss
- A toolbar pill / toast on the WelcomeView confirming the active provider after consent flow completes ("Local AI ready — Gemma 4 E4B")
- A persistent indicator in the toolbar/footer showing active provider + model whenever the active provider changes (broader, more useful long-term)

Found during sandbox walk verification of `local-ai-provider-actually-switches` branch (4 May 2026). Not blocking alpha — fixes there are correct, the persistence works, but the speed of the happy-path tells the user nothing.

## Ideas (captured, not triaged)

- **Post-TestFlight: adopt `mise` / `uv` / `just` per `docs/design-dev-environment.md`** (6 May 2026) — Phase 0 (skill-level desktop-binary symlinks) **landed 6 May 2026**; Phases 1–4 are post-cohort-feedback only. Don't open as a branch during the alpha sprint. The doc is the parking lot. One open chip flagged in the doc's "Codesigning vs symlinks" section: change `rsync -a` → `rsync -aL` in the xcodeproj `Copy Sidecar Resources` script so `models/` ships as real bytes, not a dangling symlink. Verify production sidecar path first — may be redundant.
- **Doctor "(bundled)" annotation on FFmpeg path** (2 May 2026, parked from `bundled-binary-helper` review) — `bristlenose doctor` reports the resolved ffmpeg path even when it's bundle-relative inside the .app. Honest diagnostic vs add a `(bundled)` suffix so TestFlight users aren't surprised by absolute paths inside their `.app`. Product call. Park until alpha tester feedback says it's confusing. Reference: `bristlenose/doctor.py:check_ffmpeg`
- **Merge `bundled*Environment(for:)` Swift helpers when a third lands** (2 May 2026, parked from `bundled-binary-helper` review) — `BristlenoseShared.sslEnvironment(for:)` and `bundledBinaryEnvironment(for:)` are called back-to-back at every spawn site (`PipelineRunner.swift`, `ServeManager.swift`). At three helpers the two for-loops become real boilerplate; consolidate into a single `bundledSidecarEnvironment(for:)` then. Rule of Three — wait for it
- **Bridge the 1.5 GB Whisper-model first-run download with something to do** (3 May 2026) — Mac Background-Assets path (and any equivalent on other channels) will start fetching the model after first launch, but on a slow connection that's many minutes of dead air before the user can transcribe. Don't let the app feel inert. Options to explore: a bundled sample project (real audio + canned transcripts/quotes) the user can poke around in to learn the UI; a guided tour of the report surfaces; "what's downloading and why" progress affordance that's visible but not modal; pre-flight prompts during onboarding ("import existing transcripts" path is fully usable without the model). Goal: buy minutes of valid product experience while the engine lands. Surfaces near `docs/design-desktop-python-runtime.md` Background Assets work.
- **Feedback pipeline → Bristlenose (internal dogfooding)** (17 Apr 2026) — IMAP fetch from feedback@bristlenose.app (DreamHost) → deterministic PII/header strip (Presidio + salted anon IDs for sender stability) → redacted `.md` archive in gitignored dir → monthly batch ingest into a private Bristlenose project to cluster themes for roadmap input. Read-only, never used as demo data, never shipped. Consent-safe because it stays internal. Caveats: emails are many short sessions (not few long ones) — may need a batch mode or synthetic "session per month"; no moderator questions so question-pill logic doesn't apply.
- **Incremental analysis methodology (post-TF reanalysis)** (13 May 2026) — design doc captured at `docs/design-incremental-analysis.md`. No implementation. Surface when a TestFlight tester adds new interviews to a project that's already been analysed and wants the delta, not a full re-run. Cost question: which pipeline stages can re-use cached output and which must re-run when the corpus changes.
- **ASR backend strategy** (11 May 2026) — design doc captured at `docs/design-asr-backend-strategy.md`. Articulates the mlx-only-on-Apple-Silicon vs faster-whisper-on-x86 split, platform-transcripts (Teams Premium / Zoom paid) as optimisation. Phase 1 marked shipped at capture time; later phases not scheduled.
- **Native-vs-web surfaces** (12 May 2026) — design note captured at `docs/design-native-vs-web-surfaces.md` (alongside `reset-app-state.sh`). Categorises which surfaces should be native Mac vs WKWebView; informs future port-of-UI decisions. No implementation queue.
- **CLI-UX codebook (cli-ux.yaml) + analysis-register companion + asciinema session-matching design note** (11 May 2026) — captured as two phases. Phase 1 already on disk: `bristlenose/server/codebook/cli-ux.yaml` (6 groups, 35 tags, audience-aware preamble) + `docs/design-cli-analysis-register.md` (register rules for emitting reports that land with API designers / DX engineers / OSS maintainers, not classical UXRs — codebook-aware prompt variants in `bristlenose/llm/prompts/`, headline blocks, bug-stub emission). Phase 2 deferred: `docs/design-cli-session-matching.md` covers asciinema + paste-log ingestion, 90% case is remote Teams/Meet/Zoom call with participant emailing terminal artifact afterwards, primary privacy control is the disposable-VM + revoked-keys research protocol, redaction is defence-in-depth. Don't start Phase 2 until Phase 1 has produced reports the audience finds useful. Cheapest move when scheduled: `cli-register` variants of `extract_quotes` + `generate_themes` prompts, sandpit-sized week, no new pipeline stages or DB changes.

**GitHub Issues is the source of truth for actionable tasks:** https://github.com/cassiocassio/bristlenose/issues

**Launch plan:** `docs/private/100days.md` — triaged by topic and MoSCoW priority.

This file contains: session reminders, done history, dependency maintenance, and reference tables.

## Dependency maintenance

Bristlenose has ~30 direct + transitive deps across Python, ML, LLM SDKs, and NLP. CI runs `pip-audit` + `npm audit` on every push (informational, non-blocking). Dependabot opens weekly PRs for both ecosystems. CodeQL SAST runs on push + weekly. See `SECURITY.md` for remediation SLA.

### Quarterly dep review (next: May 2026, then Aug 2026, Nov 2026)

- [ ] **May 2026** — Run `pip list --outdated`. Bump floor pins in `pyproject.toml` only if there's a security fix, a feature you need, or the floor is 2+ major versions behind
- [ ] **Aug 2026** — Same
- [ ] **Nov 2026** — Same

### Annual review (next: Feb 2027)

- [ ] **Feb 2027** — Full annual review:
  - Check Python EOL dates — Python 3.10 EOL is Oct 2026; if past EOL, bump `requires-python`, `target-version`, `python_version`
  - Check faster-whisper / ctranslate2 project health
  - Check spaCy major version
  - Check Pydantic major version
  - Rebuild snap; review `pip-audit` CI output

### Risk register

| Dependency | Risk | Escape hatch |
|---|---|---|
| faster-whisper / ctranslate2 | High — fragile chain, maintenance varies | `mlx-whisper` (macOS), `whisper.cpp` bindings |
| spaCy + thinc + presidio | Medium — spaCy 3.x pins thinc 8.x | Contained to PII stage; can pin 3.x indefinitely |
| anthropic / openai SDKs | Low — backward-compatible | Floor pins are fine |
| Pydantic | Low — stable at 2.x | Large migration but not urgent |
| Python itself | Low (now) — 3.10 EOL Oct 2026 | Bump floor at EOL |
| protobuf (transitive) | Low — CVE-2026-0994 (DoS); we don't parse untrusted protobuf | Resolves when patched |

## Done (reverse chronological)

- [x] **FOSSDA pipeline throughput baseline** (Apr 2026) — manual measurement procedure for per-stage wall-clock times, LLM latency, peak RSS, peak mid-run temp WAV against 10 FOSSDA interviews. Added `logger.info("llm_request | ...")` in `LLMClient.analyze()` so request-latency median/p95 is derivable from `bristlenose.log`. Ran two usual-suspects passes; fixes covered thermal stabilisation, ANSI-strip, hardware-key capture, Welford vs elapsed clarification. See `docs/design-perf-fossda-baseline.md`
- [x] **CLAUDE.md refactor** (Apr 2026) — offloaded reference material (lookup tables, feature specs, action catalogues) from 5 CLAUDE.md files into 8 new docs + 3 existing docs. Total CLAUDE.md down 1,995→1,527 lines (-23%). New docs: `design-desktop-menu-actions`, `design-desktop-settings`, `design-sentiment-charts`, `design-badge-action-pill`, `design-dashboard-navigation`, `design-react-islands`, `design-autocode`, `design-react-migration-status`. Gotchas/conventions/patterns preserved; reference lookups moved with one-liner pointers
- [x] **Platform text forking** (Mar 2026) — `dt()`/`ct()` helpers in `platformTranslation.ts` for CLI vs desktop help text. Desktop namespace loaded conditionally in i18next. 4 keys forked (privacy PII, contributing, config reference). Desktop variants in all 6 locales. Terminology glossary (`docs/glossary.md`) and platform text map (`docs/platform-text-map.md`) as foundation docs for future docs-review agent. SECURITY.md desktop callout added.
- [x] **Export security + design docs** (Mar 2026) — XSS fix (`ensure_ascii=True`), `safe_filename()` utility (21 tests), path stripping from exports, anonymise label clarity (5 locales). Split `design-export-sharing.md` monolith into 4 focused design docs: HTML, quotes, clips, Miro. Cross-cutting concerns (anonymisation matrix, shared infrastructure, audit logging) documented in `design-export-html.md`
- [x] **Pipeline resilience Phase 2b** (Mar 2026) — verify content hashes on load, manifest invalidation on mismatch, lazy LLM client init
