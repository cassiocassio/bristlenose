# Honorific prefixes that appear before a person's name.
#
# Used by suggest_short_names() to strip leading titles so that
# "Dr. Sarah Jones" suggests "Sarah" not "Dr.".
#
# Format: one entry per line, lowercase, WITHOUT trailing periods.
# Callers strip periods from the input token before checking membership.
# Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored.

# Maintenance
# -----------
# Add new entries as needed.  Keep sorted within each section.
# Only include prefixes that commonly appear BEFORE a person's name in
# written text.  Skip suffixes (PhD, Jr, Esq, OBE, etc.).
# Multi-word prefixes ("Tan Sri", "Air Marshal") are not supported by
# the current single-token stripping logic — don't add them here.
