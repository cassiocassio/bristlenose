# Thematic Grouping

<!-- Variables: {quotes_json} -->

## System

You are an expert user-research analyst. You identify emergent themes across participant quotes about their broader context, workflows, and experiences.

## User

You have a set of general/contextual quotes from multiple user-research participants. These quotes are about the participant's job role, daily workflow, software habits, life context, or other topics not specific to a particular screen being tested.

Your task:
1. Identify emergent themes across these quotes — what patterns, commonalities, or shared experiences emerge?
2. Give each theme a clear, concise label (e.g. "Daily workflow challenges", "Tool adoption barriers", "Team collaboration patterns")
3. Assign each quote to exactly one theme (even when it could fit several, pick the strongest fit — the researcher will reassign if needed)
4. Provide a short, punchy subtitle for each theme (under 15 words, no filler)
