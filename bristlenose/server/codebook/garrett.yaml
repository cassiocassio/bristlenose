  Five mutually exclusive planes from abstract strategy to concrete surface
  design. A top-down framework for placing findings in the UX decision
  hierarchy. Each plane describes a different layer of product decisions —
  from why we build it (Strategy) to what it looks like (Surface).

preamble: >
  The following tags describe five layers of a designed product or interface,
  from abstract to concrete. The layers are mutually exclusive — a finding
  belongs on one plane, not multiple. When a quote could arguably sit on two
  planes, choose the one that best describes what the participant is reacting
  to: the conceptual organisation, or the specific interface element. If the
  participant is not discussing a designed product, interface, or service, do
  not apply any tag from this codebook.

  - name: Strategy
    subtitle: Is the product solving the right problem for the right users?
    colour_set: ux
    tags:
      - name: user need
        definition: >
          A core problem or desire the participant brings to the product —
          the reason they showed up in the first place.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes what they came to do, what problem they
          need solved, or what outcome they are trying to achieve at a
          fundamental level. Look for "I need," "I'm looking for," "what I
          really want is."
        not_this: >
          If they name a specific absent feature or content type, that's
          feature requirement or content requirement (Scope). User need is
          the underlying motivation, not a particular solution to it.

      - name: business objective
        definition: >
          Evidence of what the organisation behind the product is optimising
          for — revenue, retention, conversion, brand positioning.
        apply_when: >
          The participant notices or reacts to a design decision that appears
          to serve the business rather than the user, or comments on the
          commercial intent behind a feature. Look for "they obviously want
          me to," "this feels like a sales thing," "I can tell they're
          trying to."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is questioning whether the product's overall
          offering matches their needs, that's value proposition. Business
          objective is about the organisation's goals being visible in the
          design, not the participant's own goals.

      - name: success metric
        definition: >
          How the participant judges whether the product delivered on its
          promise — their personal criteria for success or failure.
        apply_when: >
          The participant states criteria for evaluating the product,
          compares against a personal benchmark, or describes what "good"
          would look like. Look for "if it could just," "the test for me
          is," "what matters is whether."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is describing what they came to do rather than
          how they judge success, that's user need. If they are weighing
          whether the trade-off is worth it, that's value proposition.

      - name: value proposition
        definition: >
          The participant's assessment of whether the product's overall
          offering is worth their time, money, or attention — the
          cost-benefit equation.
        apply_when: >
          The participant weighs the product against alternatives, questions
          whether it's worth the effort, or evaluates the whole proposition.
          Look for "why would I use this instead of," "it's not worth,"
          "the appeal is."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is describing a specific unmet need, that's
          user need. If they notice the business trying to push a behaviour,
          that's business objective. Value proposition is the overall "is
          this for me?" judgement.

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Scope — what it includes and excludes
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------
  - name: Scope
    subtitle: What features and content are included or excluded?
    colour_set: emo
    tags:
      - name: feature requirement
        definition: >
          A functional capability that the participant expects, requests,
          or notes is missing — a tool, action, or interactive behaviour.
        apply_when: >
          The participant says they want to do something the product
          doesn't let them do, or praises a feature that exists. The gap
          is functional: a filter, a sort, a comparison, a save. Look for
          "can I," "there's no way to," "it would be useful if."
        not_this: >
          If the gap is informational rather than functional — missing
          text, specs, images, descriptions — that's content requirement.
          If the participant questions whether the feature should exist at
          all given the product's purpose, that's scope creep.

      - name: content requirement
        definition: >
          Information, media, or editorial content that the participant
          expects to find — text, specifications, images, guides,
          descriptions.
        apply_when: >
          The participant notes that information is absent, insufficient,
          or poorly written. The gap is informational, not functional.
          Look for "they don't have any," "there's no info about," "I'd
          want to see [data/specs/photos]."
        not_this: >
          If the participant wants to do something (filter, sort, compare)
          rather than read something, that's feature requirement. If the
          content exists but is in the wrong place, that's information
          architecture (Structure).

      - name: priority
        definition: >
          The participant's judgement about what matters most or least —
          which features or content deserve more or less attention.
        apply_when: >
          The participant ranks, compares, or triages features or content
          areas by importance. Look for "the most important thing is," "I
          don't care about X but Y is essential," "if I had to choose."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is simply noting that something is missing,
          that's feature requirement or content requirement. Priority is
          about relative importance between things, not about the presence
          or absence of a single thing.

      - name: scope creep
        definition: >
          The product tries to do too much, includes unnecessary features,
          or has strayed from its core purpose.
        apply_when: >
          The participant feels the product is bloated, unfocused, or
          includes things that don't belong. Look for "why does it have,"
          "this is trying to do too much," "I don't need all this."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is questioning the overall purpose rather
          than noting excess, that's value proposition (Strategy). Scope
          creep is about the product overreaching, not about whether its
          core proposition is right.

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Structure — conceptual organisation
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------
  - name: Structure
    subtitle: How is information organised conceptually?
    colour_set: task
    tags:
      - name: interaction design
        definition: >
          How the product defines the behaviour of interactive elements in
          response to user actions — the rules of what happens when you do
          things.
        apply_when: >
          The participant comments on how the system responds to actions at
          a conceptual level: state changes, transitions, rules governing
          behaviour. Look for "when I do X it does Y," "I expected it to
          behave like," "the way it handles."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is talking about where content lives in a
          category hierarchy, that's information architecture. If they're
          describing a specific sequence of steps to complete a goal,
          that's task flow. Interaction design is about the behavioural
          rules of individual elements.

      - name: information architecture
        definition: >
          How content is categorised, labelled, and related — the
          conceptual structure of where things belong and how they connect.
        apply_when: >
          The participant expresses confusion or satisfaction about how
          content is grouped, where a category boundary falls, or what
          belongs together. Look for "I would have expected X to be under
          Y," "why is this here," "the way they've organised."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is commenting on specific navigation controls
          (menus, links, breadcrumbs), that's navigation pattern. If
          they're reacting to the visual position of an element on screen,
          that's interface layout (Skeleton). Information architecture is
          about the conceptual model of where things belong, not the UI
          that exposes it.

      - name: navigation pattern
        definition: >
          The conceptual approach to moving through the product — how
          paths, links, and wayfinding structures are designed as a system.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes how they move between areas, whether
          routes feel logical, or how wayfinding works as a system. Look
          for "I keep having to go back to," "there's no way to get from
          X to Y," "the navigation makes sense."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is talking about where a specific menu or
          link sits on the page, that's component placement (Skeleton).
          If they're describing the category structure rather than the
          paths between areas, that's information architecture. Navigation
          pattern is about the system of paths, not individual controls
          or category groupings.

      - name: task flow
        definition: >
          The sequence of steps required to accomplish a goal — whether
          the path from intent to completion is logical, efficient, and
          predictable.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes a multi-step process, comments on step
          ordering, or notes friction in a sequence of actions toward a
          goal. Look for "first I had to X, then Y," "why do I have to do
          this before that," "the process is."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is commenting on how a single element
          behaves, that's interaction design. If they're describing
          wayfinding between areas rather than steps in a process, that's
          navigation pattern. Task flow is about the end-to-end sequence
          toward a goal.

  # Skeleton — element arrangement
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------
  - name: Skeleton
    subtitle: How are interface elements arranged?
    colour_set: trust
    tags:
      - name: interface layout
        definition: >
          The overall spatial arrangement of a page or screen — how
          regions, columns, whitespace, and content blocks are distributed.
        apply_when: >
          The participant reacts to the overall page structure: crowded or
          spacious, balanced or lopsided, scannable or overwhelming. Look
          for "this page feels," "there's too much going on," "the layout
          is clean."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is commenting on where a specific element
          sits rather than the overall layout, that's component placement.
          If they're reacting to visual aesthetics (colours, fonts,
          imagery), that's Surface. Interface layout is about spatial
          structure, not the identity of individual elements or their
          visual treatment.

      - name: wireframe issue
        definition: >
          A problem with the structural skeleton of the interface that
          would be visible even without visual styling — content
          hierarchy, element sizing, reading order.
        apply_when: >
          The participant notes that something important is de-emphasised,
          something minor is too prominent, or the visual hierarchy
          doesn't match importance. Look for "this should be bigger," "I
          almost missed," "why is this so prominent."
        not_this: >
          If the problem is about where an element is positioned, that's
          component placement. If it's about the overall page density,
          that's interface layout. Wireframe issue is about content
          hierarchy and emphasis — the relative visual weight of elements.

      - name: convention
        definition: >
          Whether the interface follows or breaks established UI
          conventions that users bring from other products.
        apply_when: >
          The participant expects an element to behave or appear the way
          it does on other sites, or is surprised when a standard pattern
          is absent. Look for "usually you can," "on other sites," "I'd
          expect this to work like."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is describing conceptual organisation rather
          than interface conventions, that's information architecture
          (Structure). If the comment is about visual styling norms,
          that's brand alignment (Surface). Convention is about
          behavioural and layout patterns users expect from prior product
          experience.

      - name: component placement
        definition: >
          Where a specific interface element (button, link, menu, form
          field) is positioned on the page and whether that position is
          findable and logical.
        apply_when: >
          The participant comments on where a particular control or
          element sits: easy to find, buried, in the wrong place, or
          perfectly positioned. Look for "I can't find the," "this should
          be up here," "the button is right where I expected."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is describing the overall page composition,
          that's interface layout. If they're talking about paths between
          pages rather than the position of a control on one page, that's
          navigation pattern (Structure). Component placement is about one
          specific element's location.

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Surface — visual treatment
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------
  - name: Surface
    subtitle: What is the visual treatment?
    colour_set: opp
    tags:
      - name: visual design
        definition: >
          The quality and effectiveness of the visual presentation —
          colour, typography, imagery, iconography, and graphic treatment.
        apply_when: >
          The participant comments on specific visual elements: photos,
          colours, fonts, icons, graphics. Look for "the photos are," "I
          like the colours," "the icons are," "the font is."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is describing an overall emotional or sensory
          impression rather than specific visual elements, that's sensory
          experience. If they're judging whether the visuals match the
          brand's identity, that's brand alignment. Visual design is about
          the craft of individual visual elements.

      - name: sensory experience
        definition: >
          The overall feel, mood, or atmosphere the product creates
          through its combined visual, motion, and auditory design.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes an overall impression or emotional
          response to how the product looks and feels as a whole, rather
          than specific elements. Look for "it feels premium," "this
          looks cheap," "the whole vibe is," "it gives me a sense of."
        not_this: >
          If the participant points to a specific visual element (a photo,
          a colour, an icon), that's visual design. If they're judging
          authenticity or trustworthiness rather than atmosphere, that's
          brand alignment. Sensory experience is the holistic feel, not
          individual elements or brand judgements.

      - name: brand alignment
        definition: >
          Whether the visual presentation communicates the right identity,
          credibility, and market positioning for the brand.
        apply_when: >
          The participant judges whether the product looks like it belongs
          to its category, appears trustworthy, or matches expectations
          for the kind of business it is. Look for "it looks
          professional," "this doesn't look like a real shop," "it feels
          like a proper [specialist/retailer/brand]."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is reacting to the general mood or
          atmosphere, that's sensory experience. If they're commenting on
          specific visual elements, that's visual design. Brand alignment
          is about what the visuals communicate about the organisation's
          identity and credibility.

      - name: aesthetic reaction
        definition: >
          The participant's immediate, subjective response to visual
          beauty or ugliness — pure taste rather than analysis.
        apply_when: >
          The participant expresses a gut reaction to visual appeal
          without analysing why: they simply like or dislike how it looks.
          Look for "that's nice," "ugh," "I love this," "that's ugly," or
          non-verbal reactions to visual elements.
        not_this: >
          If the participant explains what specifically they like or
          dislike (photos, colours, fonts), that's visual design. If they
          describe an overall mood, that's sensory experience. Aesthetic
          reaction is the unanalysed gut response — taste, not critique.
