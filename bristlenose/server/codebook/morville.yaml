description: >
  Seven facets of user experience arranged as a honeycomb — useful, usable,
  desirable, findable, accessible, credible, valuable. A broader evaluation
  framework than Garrett or Norman, designed to ask whether a product
  delivers on every quality dimension, not just ease of use. Particularly
  strong at surfacing credibility and findability findings that other
  frameworks miss.

preamble: >
  The following tags describe seven quality dimensions of user experience.
  Unlike frameworks that diagnose specific interaction breakdowns (Norman)
  or locate findings on a design stack (Garrett), these tags ask whether
  the product is succeeding on a broader set of quality dimensions —
  including credibility, findability, and desirability that interaction
  frameworks often miss. The facets are not mutually exclusive — a single
  finding can reveal problems on multiple dimensions. When a quote touches
  two facets, choose the one the participant is primarily reacting to. If
  the participant is not discussing a designed product, service, or
  information system, do not apply any tag from this codebook.

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------
  - name: Useful
    subtitle: Does the product actually solve a real problem for its users?
    colour_set: ux
    tags:
      - name: relevance
        definition: >
          The product or feature addresses a genuine need in the
          participant's life — it solves a problem they actually have,
          not one the product imagines they have.
        apply_when: >
          The participant connects the product to a real situation in
          their life, or notes that a feature matches something they
          genuinely need. Look for "this is exactly what I needed,"
          "I've been looking for something like this," "this solves my
          problem."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is evaluating the cost-benefit trade-off,
          that's worth it (Valuable). Relevance is about whether the
          product addresses a real need, not whether the exchange is
          fair.

      - name: problem-solution fit
        definition: >
          The product's approach to solving the problem is appropriate —
          it solves the right problem in the right way, not just any
          problem or the right problem badly.
        apply_when: >
          The participant comments on whether the product's approach
          matches the actual problem, or notes a mismatch between what
          the product offers and what they need. Look for "this isn't
          really what I need," "it does X but I need Y," "they've
          nailed it," "close but not quite."
        not_this: >
          If the participant questions whether the product has the right
          features, that's feature gap. If the product is useful but
          the interaction is poor, that's a Usable issue. Problem-
          solution fit is about conceptual alignment between the offering
          and the need.

      - name: utility
        definition: >
          The product provides practical, functional value — it helps
          the participant accomplish tasks or achieve outcomes more
          effectively than without it.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes concrete practical benefits they get
          from the product, or notes that a feature is genuinely helpful
          in getting things done. Look for "this saves me," "I use this
          every day for," "it actually helps me," "this makes my job
          easier."
        not_this: >
          If the participant enjoys using the product beyond its
          functional value, that's emotional appeal (Desirable). If
          they're commenting on ease of use rather than usefulness,
          that's a Usable issue. Utility is about practical outcomes,
          not the experience of achieving them.

      - name: feature gap
        definition: >
          The participant identifies a missing capability that would make
          the product genuinely more useful — a functional hole that
          limits the product's ability to solve their problem.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes something the product should do but
          doesn't, reducing its usefulness for their real situation.
          Look for "if only it could," "the one thing it's missing is,"
          "I still have to use X for that," "it would be so much more
          useful if."
        not_this: >
          If the participant can't find a feature that exists, that's a
          Findable issue, not a feature gap. If the gap is about content
          or information rather than capability, consider whether the
          finding is about findability or usefulness. Feature gap is
          about genuinely absent functionality.

  # Usable — can people actually use it?
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------
  - name: Usable
    subtitle: Can people use it effectively without unnecessary difficulty?
    colour_set: emo
    tags:
      - name: ease of use
        definition: >
          The product is straightforward to use — the participant can
          accomplish their goal without confusion, hesitation, or
          unnecessary effort.
        apply_when: >
          The participant comments on how easy or difficult the product
          is to use in the moment. Look for "that was easy," "I didn't
          have to think," "straightforward," "this is confusing," "I
          can't figure out how to."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is describing the initial learning
          experience specifically, that's learnability. If they know how
          to use it but it takes too many steps, that's efficiency. Ease
          of use is about in-the-moment clarity, not the learning curve
          or speed.

      - name: learnability
        definition: >
          How quickly the participant can get up to speed — the initial
          investment required to become competent with the product.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes their learning experience, compares
          initial confusion with later competence, or comments on the
          onboarding process. Look for "once you figure it out," "the
          learning curve is," "at first I had no idea but now," "it
          took me a while to get the hang of."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is describing ongoing difficulty (not an
          initial learning phase), that's ease of use. If they learned
          from other people or external resources, consider whether
          the finding is about the product's learnability or about
          external support. Learnability is about the transition from
          novice to competent.

      - name: efficiency
        definition: >
          The product lets the participant accomplish their goal with
          minimal wasted time, steps, or effort — once they know how
          to use it, the process is streamlined.
        apply_when: >
          The participant comments on speed, number of steps, or effort
          required for a task they already understand. Look for "too
          many clicks," "this should be faster," "I can do it but it
          takes forever," "nice, that was quick," "why so many steps."
        not_this: >
          If the participant doesn't know how to proceed (not slow but
          stuck), that's ease of use. If they're commenting on system
          performance (loading times) rather than interaction steps,
          that's outside this tag — consider whether the finding is
          really about the UX or the technology. Efficiency is about
          workflow streamlining, not comprehension.

      - name: error tolerance
        definition: >
          The product handles mistakes gracefully — the participant can
          recover from errors without losing work, hitting dead ends,
          or feeling punished for missteps.
        apply_when: >
          The participant makes a mistake and comments on how the
          product responds — whether they could undo, whether they
          lost work, whether the error message helped. Look for "I
          accidentally," "there's no undo," "it let me fix that
          easily," "I lost everything," "good, it warned me."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is worried about making mistakes
          (anticipatory), that's closer to a Credible concern about
          safety. If the error is about not understanding the system
          rather than recovering from a mistake, that's ease of use.
          Error tolerance is about the product's response to errors,
          not the errors themselves.

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Desirable — does it create emotional engagement?
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------
  - name: Desirable
    subtitle: Does the design create a positive emotional connection?
    colour_set: opp
    tags:
      - name: emotional appeal
        definition: >
          The product evokes a positive emotional response — the
          participant feels drawn to it, enjoys using it, or experiences
          pleasure beyond functional satisfaction.
        apply_when: >
          The participant expresses feelings about the product that go
          beyond utility — delight, pride, enjoyment, affection. Look
          for "I love this," "it makes me feel," "I enjoy using it,"
          "it's fun," "this is delightful," "it brings me joy."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is commenting on specific visual elements
          (colours, fonts, imagery), that's aesthetic quality. If
          they're expressing brand affinity, that's brand perception.
          Emotional appeal is the holistic feeling the product evokes,
          not the analysis of what causes it.

      - name: aesthetic quality
        definition: >
          The visual and sensory design of the product — its look, feel,
          and polish. Whether the product is beautiful, ugly, modern,
          dated, or visually coherent.
        apply_when: >
          The participant comments on the visual presentation, design
          quality, or sensory experience. Look for "it looks great,"
          "the design is clean," "this looks dated," "the colours are,"
          "it feels polished," "the animations are nice."
        not_this: >
          If the participant describes an overall emotional response
          without analysing visual elements, that's emotional appeal.
          If they're judging whether the visuals communicate the right
          identity, that's brand perception. If the visual treatment
          affects usability (can't read text, poor contrast), that's
          a Usable or Accessible issue. Aesthetic quality is about
          visual craft judgement.

      - name: brand perception
        definition: >
          The product communicates a specific identity, personality, and
          market position through its design — the participant forms an
          impression of what kind of organisation is behind it.
        apply_when: >
          The participant judges the organisation through the product's
          design, or comments on whether the product matches their
          expectations for the brand. Look for "it feels like a proper,"
          "this doesn't look like a serious," "the brand comes
          through," "it feels premium," "it looks cheap."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is judging trustworthiness or honesty,
          that's a Credible issue, not brand perception. If they're
          reacting to visual beauty without connecting it to brand
          identity, that's aesthetic quality. Brand perception is about
          what the design communicates about the organisation.

      - name: engagement
        definition: >
          The product holds the participant's attention and draws them
          back — it's compelling, not just functional. The participant
          wants to spend time with it.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes wanting to explore further, losing
          track of time, returning repeatedly, or being drawn in. Look
          for "I kept exploring," "I couldn't put it down," "I come
          back to this," "it's addictive," "I find myself spending
          time."
        not_this: >
          If the participant returns because the product is useful (not
          because it's compelling), that's return intent (Valuable). If
          they're describing a single moment of delight rather than
          sustained engagement, that's emotional appeal. Engagement is
          about sustained attention and pull, not momentary pleasure.

  # Findable — can users locate what they need?
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------
  - name: Findable
    subtitle: Can users find the content, features, and information they need?
    colour_set: task
    tags:
      - name: navigation clarity
        definition: >
          The navigation system helps the participant understand where
          they are, where things live, and how to get to what they need —
          the wayfinding system works.
        apply_when: >
          The participant comments on menus, links, breadcrumbs, tabs,
          or other navigation elements — whether they help or hinder
          finding things. Look for "I knew exactly where to go," "the
          menu makes sense," "I keep getting lost," "where am I," "how
          do I get back."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is commenting on the conceptual
          organisation of content (categories, groupings) rather than
          navigation controls, consider whether the finding is about
          findability or information architecture (Garrett → Structure).
          Navigation clarity is about the wayfinding interface, not the
          underlying conceptual structure.

      - name: search effectiveness
        definition: >
          The product's search functionality helps the participant find
          what they're looking for — search works well, returns
          relevant results, and supports the way people actually look
          for things.
        apply_when: >
          The participant uses or comments on search functionality. Look
          for "I searched for," "the results weren't helpful," "search
          found it immediately," "I typed X and got Y," "there's no
          search," "the filters helped me narrow down."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is browsing or navigating (not searching),
          that's navigation clarity. If the content they want doesn't
          exist (not just hard to find), that's feature gap (Useful).
          Search effectiveness is about the search-and-filter tools
          specifically.

      - name: content discoverability
        definition: >
          Content, features, or information the participant needs are
          easy to locate within the product — they surface naturally
          rather than being buried or hidden.
        apply_when: >
          The participant finds or fails to find content they need —
          not through search or navigation specifically, but through
          the general visibility and prominence of information. Look
          for "I didn't know that was there," "this was buried," "oh,
          I didn't see that," "it's right where I expected," "I almost
          missed this."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is commenting on navigation controls, that's
          navigation clarity. If the content genuinely doesn't exist,
          that's feature gap (Useful). If a specific interactive control
          lacks visual cues, that's a signifier issue (Norman). Content
          discoverability is about whether existing content is prominent
          enough to be found.

      - name: labelling
        definition: >
          The words used in the interface — menu labels, button text,
          category names, headings — help or hinder the participant's
          ability to find and understand what they need.
        apply_when: >
          The participant is confused by or helped by the terminology
          used in the interface, or can't match their vocabulary to the
          product's vocabulary. Look for "what does X mean," "I'd call
          that Y," "the label doesn't make sense," "I knew what that
          meant immediately," "I wouldn't have looked under that name."
        not_this: >
          If the participant understands the label but disagrees with
          the categorisation, that's navigation clarity or information
          architecture (Garrett → Structure). If the wording affects
          trust rather than findability, that's a Credible issue.
          Labelling is about the match between the product's vocabulary
          and the participant's vocabulary.

    subtitle: Can people with diverse abilities and contexts use it effectively?
    colour_set: trust
    tags:
      - name: inclusive design
        definition: >
          The product accommodates people with diverse physical,
          sensory, or cognitive abilities — it doesn't assume one kind
          of user or one way of interacting.
        apply_when: >
          The participant encounters or comments on the product's
          accommodation (or lack of it) for diverse abilities. Look for
          "I can't read this text," "there's no way to increase the
          size," "the contrast is too low," "it works with my screen
          reader," "the audio has captions."
        not_this: >
          If the participant faces difficulty that any user would face
          (not specific to ability or context), that's a Usable issue.
          If the text is small because of a visual design choice rather
          than an accessibility failure, consider aesthetic quality
          (Desirable). Inclusive design is specifically about
          accommodating diverse abilities and needs.

      - name: assistive compatibility
        definition: >
          The product works with assistive technologies — screen
          readers, voice control, keyboard navigation, switch devices,
          and other tools people with disabilities rely on.
        apply_when: >
          The participant uses or attempts to use assistive technology
          with the product. Look for "my screen reader can't," "I
          can't tab to this," "it works with voice control," "the
          keyboard navigation is," "focus order doesn't make sense."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is using standard interaction methods (not
          assistive technology) and having difficulty, that's a Usable
          issue. Assistive compatibility is specifically about
          compatibility with tools used by people with disabilities.

      - name: cognitive accessibility
        definition: >
          The product doesn't overload the participant with too much
          information, too many choices, or too much complexity —
          it respects cognitive limits and varied cognitive abilities.
        apply_when: >
          The participant feels overwhelmed by information density,
          complexity, or the number of options presented. Look for
          "there's too much going on," "I can't take all this in,"
          "it's overwhelming," "too many choices," "I need it simpler,"
          "my brain hurts."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is confused by a specific interaction (not
          by overall complexity), that's ease of use (Usable). If the
          visual layout is cluttered but the participant isn't
          describing cognitive strain, consider aesthetic quality
          (Desirable). Cognitive accessibility is about the mental
          demand placed on the user, not visual clutter alone.

      - name: situational access
        definition: >
          The product works in the participant's real-world context —
          on their device, in their environment, in their language,
          under their connectivity conditions.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes using the product in a specific
          context that affects their experience — on a phone, in bright
          sunlight, with one hand, in a noisy environment, with slow
          internet. Look for "on my phone it," "I couldn't see the
          screen because," "when I'm on the bus," "it doesn't work
          offline," "it's not in my language."
        not_this: >
          If the difficulty is about permanent disability rather than
          situational context, that's inclusive design. If the
          participant is switching between devices as a behaviour
          pattern, consider whether the finding is about accessibility
          or about the product's cross-platform strategy. Situational
          access is about temporary or environmental constraints.

        definition: >
          The participant forms an overall judgement about whether the
          product and the organisation behind it can be trusted — whether
          they feel safe giving it their time, data, or money.
        apply_when: >
          The participant makes trust judgements about the product or
          its creators. Look for "I don't trust this," "it feels
          legit," "I wouldn't put my card details in here," "it seems
          reliable," "something feels off," "I feel safe using this."

          If the participant is commenting on the visual impression of
          professionalism, that's brand perception (Desirable). If
          they're evaluating the accuracy of specific content, that's
          content accuracy. Trustworthiness is the holistic trust
          judgement, not visual impression or factual accuracy alone.

      - name: content accuracy
        definition: >
          The participant evaluates whether the product's content —
          descriptions, specifications, claims, prices, dates — is
          accurate, current, and honest.
        apply_when: >
          The participant questions or confirms the accuracy of specific
          information in the product. Look for "is this up to date,"
          "that price is wrong," "the description doesn't match," "I
          checked and it's accurate," "this information seems old."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is making a general trust judgement (not
          about specific content), that's trustworthiness. If the
          content is accurate but misleading in how it's presented,
          that's transparency. Content accuracy is about factual
          correctness of specific claims.

      - name: transparency
        definition: >
          The product is open about its practices — pricing, data
          collection, terms, algorithms, and business model. The
          participant can understand what's happening and why.
        apply_when: >
          The participant comments on whether the product is upfront
          about what it does, what it costs, or how it uses their
          data. Look for "why do they need this," "hidden fees," "it's
          not clear what happens to my data," "I like that they
          explain," "what's the catch," "the pricing is transparent."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is making a general trust judgement, that's
          trustworthiness. If they're questioning the accuracy of a
          specific claim, that's content accuracy. Transparency is
          about openness of practices and policies, not truthfulness of
          individual facts.

      - name: social proof
        definition: >
          Evidence from other people — reviews, ratings, testimonials,
          usage counts, expert endorsements — that influences the
          participant's trust in the product.
        apply_when: >
          The participant references or looks for evidence from other
          users or authorities. Look for "the reviews say," "how many
          people use this," "has anyone recommended this," "I'd want
          to see ratings," "no reviews makes me nervous," "the expert
          endorsement helped."
        not_this: >
          If other people are influencing the participant's behaviour
          through social norms (not product reviews), that's social
          influence in the UXR codebook, not social proof here. If
          the participant is judging the product's visual credibility,
          that's trustworthiness or brand perception (Desirable). Social
          proof is about third-party evidence specifically.

      - name: worth it
        definition: >
          The participant's assessment of whether the product justifies
          their investment of time, money, attention, or personal data —
          the cost-benefit equation from the user's perspective.
        apply_when: >
          The participant weighs what they get against what they give.
          Look for "it's worth the price," "not worth the hassle,"
          "I'd pay for this," "the free version is enough," "for what
          it costs," "I'm getting my money's worth."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is describing the product's usefulness
          without a value judgement, that's a Useful issue. If they're
          comparing to competitors, that's competitive value. Worth it
          is about the personal cost-benefit assessment, not the
          product's absolute quality.

      - name: competitive value
        definition: >
          The participant compares the product to alternatives —
          competitors, substitutes, or doing nothing — and judges
          whether it offers enough to win their choice.
        apply_when: >
          The participant names or implies alternatives and makes a
          comparison. Look for "compared to X," "I could just use,"
          "what makes this better than," "nothing else does this,"
          "there are cheaper options," "I switched from X because."
        not_this: >
          If the participant evaluates the product on its own merits
          (no comparison), that's worth it. If they reference a
          competitor's specific feature rather than overall value,
          consider whether the finding is about competitive positioning
          or about a feature gap (Useful). Competitive value requires
          explicit or implicit comparison.

      - name: time well spent
        definition: >
          The participant feels the product respects their time — the
          experience is worthwhile, not wasteful. They leave feeling
          they gained something rather than lost something.
        apply_when: >
          The participant comments on whether the time they spent was
          productive, enjoyable, or wasted. Look for "that was a waste
          of time," "time well spent," "I got what I needed quickly,"
          "I spent an hour and got nowhere," "it respects my time."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is commenting on task speed (too many
          steps), that's efficiency (Usable). If they feel their money
          was wasted, that's worth it. Time well spent is the
          subjective assessment of whether the time investment was
          justified by the outcome, not about the interaction speed.

      - name: return intent
        definition: >
          The participant signals whether they would use the product
          again, recommend it, or continue their relationship with it —
          the forward-looking commitment.
        apply_when: >
          The participant expresses intent about future use or
          recommendation. Look for "I'd definitely use this again,"
          "I'd tell my friends," "I wouldn't come back," "I'll stick
          with it," "I'm done with this," "I'd recommend it."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is describing sustained engagement in the
          current session, that's engagement (Desirable). If they're
          expressing loyalty to the brand rather than intent to return,
          that's brand perception (Desirable). Return intent is about
          the forward-looking decision to come back or not.
