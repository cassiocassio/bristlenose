description: >
  Seven fundamental principles of interaction design that explain why
  products are easy or hard to use. A bottom-up framework for diagnosing
  why interactions succeed or fail — from whether users can discover
  what's possible (Discoverability) to whether the system communicates
  what happened (Feedback) to whether errors are slips or mistakes.

preamble: >
  The following tags describe principles of interaction design. They
  describe the relationship between a person and a designed thing — how
  the design communicates what's possible, what's happening, and what
  went wrong. These tags apply to designed products, interfaces, and
  services. If the participant is describing personal experiences,
  physical activities, domain expertise, or life context without
  reference to a designed artefact, do not apply any tag from this
  codebook. Do not stretch these concepts metaphorically — "feedback"
  means a designed system communicating the result of an action, not any
  situation where a person learns something from their environment.

    subtitle: Can the user figure out what actions are possible?
    colour_set: ux
    tags:
      - name: visible action
        definition: >
          An action or feature that the participant can see and
          understand is available — the interface makes its possibilities
          obvious without requiring exploration or prior knowledge.
        apply_when: >
          The participant immediately finds what they're looking for,
          notes that a feature is prominently placed, or comments on the
          clarity of available options. Look for "I can see that I can,"
          "oh there it is," "it's obvious what to do."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is commenting on the visual cue that
          indicates how to interact (a button shape, an underline),
          that's affordance or perceived affordance (Signifiers). Visible
          action is about knowing the action exists, not about how the
          control communicates its interaction mechanism.

      - name: hidden feature
        definition: >
          A useful action or feature that exists but the participant
          cannot find — it is buried, obscured, or requires prior
          knowledge to discover.
        apply_when: >
          The participant misses something that's actually there, is
          surprised to find a feature, or asks "can I...?" about
          something the product already supports. Look for "I didn't
          know you could," "where's the option to," "oh it was hiding
          there all along."
        not_this: >
          If the participant wants something that genuinely doesn't exist
          in the product, that's not a hidden feature — it's outside this
          codebook's scope. If the participant can see the control but
          doesn't understand what it does, that's missing signifier
          (Signifiers), not hidden feature.

      - name: exploration
        definition: >
          The participant's strategy for discovering what the product
          can do — trying things, poking around, navigating without a
          clear goal, testing the boundaries of the system.
        apply_when: >
          The participant is actively experimenting: clicking things to
          see what happens, exploring menus, or narrating a trial-and-error
          strategy. Look for "let me try," "what happens if I," "I'll just
          poke around," "I'm clicking this to see."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is performing a known action with a clear
          goal, that's not exploration. If they are stuck and unable to
          proceed, look at hidden feature or missing signifier instead.
          Exploration implies active, deliberate investigation.

      - name: first-time use
        definition: >
          The participant's experience of encountering the product or a
          feature for the first time — the initial learning curve, first
          impressions, and onboarding experience.
        apply_when: >
          The participant indicates this is their first time using
          something, describes initial confusion that resolved, or
          comments on the learning curve. Look for "first time I used
          this," "when I started," "I had to figure out," "once you
          learn it."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is currently exploring (trial and error),
          that's exploration. If they already know the product and are
          describing a feature they can't find, that's hidden feature.
          First-time use is specifically about the initial encounter and
          learning threshold.

  # Feedback — does the system communicate results?
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------
  - name: Feedback
    subtitle: Does the system communicate results clearly?
    colour_set: emo
    tags:
      - name: system response
        definition: >
          The system communicates the result of a user action clearly
          and immediately — the participant knows what happened and
          that their action was registered.
        apply_when: >
          The participant notes that the system responded to their
          action, comments on a status message, animation, or visual
          change that confirms what happened. Look for "it showed me,"
          "I can see it updated," "the system told me," "good, it
          changed."
        not_this: >
          If the response came too late, that's delayed feedback. If the
          response was unclear or ambiguous, that's ambiguous feedback.
          System response is the positive case — clear, timely
          communication from the system.

      - name: delayed feedback
        definition: >
          The system takes too long to respond to the participant's
          action, leaving them uncertain whether it worked or is still
          processing.
        apply_when: >
          The participant waits for a response, wonders if their click
          registered, or comments on slowness. Look for "is it loading,"
          "did that work," "it's taking a while," "nothing happened...
          oh wait."
        not_this: >
          If the system responded quickly but the response was unclear,
          that's ambiguous feedback. If there was no response at all
          and the participant doesn't know if their action was received,
          that's also ambiguous feedback (not delayed). Delayed feedback
          specifically involves a noticeable wait.

      - name: ambiguous feedback
        definition: >
          The system responded to the participant's action but the
          response is unclear, confusing, or open to multiple
          interpretations — the participant isn't sure what happened.
        apply_when: >
          The participant sees a response but doesn't understand it,
          sees a cryptic error message, or is unsure whether their
          action succeeded. Look for "what does that mean," "did it
          save," "I'm not sure if that worked," "this message is
          confusing."
        not_this: >
          If the participant didn't receive any response at all, that's
          delayed feedback (waiting) or missing signifier (no
          indication). If the response was clear but the participant
          disagrees with the outcome, that's model mismatch (Conceptual
          model). Ambiguous feedback is about unclear communication, not
          wrong outcomes.

      - name: confirmation
        definition: >
          A deliberate checkpoint where the system asks the participant
          to verify before proceeding — "are you sure?" dialogs,
          preview screens, review steps before submission.
        apply_when: >
          The participant encounters or wishes for a confirmation step,
          comments on a review/summary screen, or worries about
          irreversible actions. Look for "it asked me to confirm," "I
          wish it had asked me first," "good that it double-checked,"
          "what if I accidentally."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is talking about the system acknowledging
          that an action completed, that's system response. Confirmation
          is specifically about the system pausing to ask "are you sure?"
          before an action, not confirming after.

  # Conceptual model — does understanding match reality?
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------
  - name: Conceptual model
    subtitle: Does user understanding match reality?
    colour_set: task
    tags:
      - name: user mental model
        definition: >
          The participant reveals their internal understanding of how the
          system works — their theory of its structure, behaviour, or
          logic, whether accurate or not.
        apply_when: >
          The participant explains how they think the system works,
          predicts what will happen, or reveals assumptions about the
          underlying logic. Look for "I assumed it would," "I think it
          works by," "my understanding is," "so this is like a."
        not_this: >
          If the participant's understanding is demonstrably wrong and
          leads to confusion, that's model mismatch. If they are
          describing the system's actual behaviour (not their theory),
          that's system model. User mental model is the participant's
          theory, regardless of whether it's correct.

      - name: system model
        definition: >
          The participant describes or reacts to how the system actually
          behaves — its real logic, structure, or rules, as revealed
          through interaction.
        apply_when: >
          The participant discovers how the system actually works,
          narrates the system's real behaviour, or comments on the
          underlying structure. Look for "oh, so it actually does," "I
          see, it works by," "the system organises things by," "it
          turns out it."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is speculating about how it works (not
          observing), that's user mental model. If the system's actual
          behaviour contradicts expectations, that's model mismatch.
          System model is factual discovery of real behaviour, not
          prediction.

      - name: model mismatch
        definition: >
          A gap between what the participant expected and what the
          system actually did — their mental model didn't match the
          system model, leading to confusion or surprise.
        apply_when: >
          The participant is surprised by the system's behaviour,
          expected something different, or discovers their assumptions
          were wrong. Look for "that's not what I expected," "why did
          it do that," "I thought it would," "wait, that's wrong."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is pleasantly surprised, consider whether
          the mismatch is about the conceptual model or about visual
          design exceeding expectations. If the participant makes an
          error because they misunderstood the system, also consider
          rule-based mistake (Slips vs Mistakes). Model mismatch is
          about the gap in understanding, not the error that results.

      - name: learned behaviour
        definition: >
          The participant applies knowledge from past experience — habits,
          conventions, or patterns learned from other products — to the
          current product.
        apply_when: >
          The participant references other products, expects conventions
          to be followed, or applies habits from elsewhere. Look for "in
          [other product] you can," "I'm used to," "normally you'd,"
          "every other app does it this way," "I expected the standard."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is building a new mental model of this
          specific product, that's user mental model. If a learned
          convention is violated and causes confusion, that's model
          mismatch (the mismatch is the primary event, learned behaviour
          is the cause). If the participant applies cultural or social
          conventions (not product-learned), that's cultural constraint
          (Constraints).

    colour_set: trust
    tags:
      - name: affordance
        definition: >
          A real, physical or interactive property of an element that
          determines what can actually be done with it — the true
          possibilities for action, regardless of whether the user
          perceives them.
        apply_when: >
          The participant interacts with something correctly because its
          form communicates its function — a button that looks pressable,
          a slider that looks draggable, a text field that looks typeable.
          Look for "I can click this," "it looks like I can drag it,"
          "this is clearly a button."
        not_this: >
          If the participant perceives an interaction possibility that
          doesn't actually exist, that's false signifier. If they fail to
          perceive a real affordance, that's missing signifier. The subtle
          distinction: affordance is about what IS possible; perceived
          affordance is about what the user BELIEVES is possible.

      - name: perceived affordance
        definition: >
          What the participant believes they can do with an interface
          element, based on visual cues — which may or may not match
          the actual affordance.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes what they think an element does
          based on its appearance, interprets a visual cue, or states
          their expectation of how to interact. Look for "this looks
          like I should," "I think I can click this," "it seems like
          this would."
        not_this: >
          If the participant's perception is correct and they
          successfully interact, that's affordance (the real thing
          matches the perception). If the perception is wrong (they try
          to click something that isn't clickable), that's false
          signifier. Perceived affordance is the in-between — the
          participant's stated belief about what's possible.

      - name: false signifier
        definition: >
          A visual cue that incorrectly suggests an interaction is
          possible — the participant tries to interact with something
          that doesn't respond as expected because the design misleads.
        apply_when: >
          The participant clicks something that isn't clickable, tries
          to interact with a decoration, or is misled by visual styling.
          Look for "I tried to click it but nothing happened," "this
          looks like a link but it's not," "I thought I could tap this."
        not_this: >
          If the interaction exists but the participant can't find it,
          that's hidden feature (Discoverability) or missing signifier.
          If the participant expected a different outcome from a real
          control, that's model mismatch (Conceptual model). False
          signifier is specifically about non-interactive elements that
          look interactive.

      - name: missing signifier
        definition: >
          An interactive element that lacks the visual cues needed to
          communicate that interaction is possible — the participant
          doesn't realise they can interact with it.
        apply_when: >
          The participant overlooks a control, doesn't realise something
          is interactive, or discovers a hidden interaction by accident.
          Look for "I didn't realise I could click that," "there's no
          indication that," "how was I supposed to know," "oh, that's
          a button?"
        not_this: >
          If the element is completely hidden (not visible at all),
          that's hidden feature (Discoverability). If the element is
          visible but styled to suggest the wrong interaction, that's
          false signifier. Missing signifier is about visible elements
          that don't look interactive enough.

      Does the relationship between controls and outcomes feel natural?
    colour_set: opp
    tags:
      - name: natural mapping
        definition: >
          The relationship between a control and its effect feels
          intuitive and obvious — the participant doesn't need to think
          about which control affects which outcome.
        apply_when: >
          The participant uses a control correctly without thinking,
          notes that the layout "makes sense," or comments on the
          intuitive arrangement. Look for "obviously this controls
          that," "it's laid out logically," "makes sense that this
          is here."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is commenting on the visual appearance of
          controls (they look clickable), that's affordance (Signifiers).
          If the spatial arrangement of elements is good but the
          comment is about position rather than control-outcome
          relationship, that's spatial correspondence. Natural mapping
          is about the logical link between action and result.

      - name: arbitrary mapping
        definition: >
          The relationship between a control and its effect is not
          intuitive — the participant has to learn or memorise which
          control does what because the mapping isn't self-evident.
        apply_when: >
          The participant uses the wrong control, can't predict which
          button does what, or notes that the arrangement is confusing.
          Look for "which one of these," "I keep pressing the wrong
          one," "why is this here and not there," "I always forget
          which is which."
        not_this: >
          If the participant can't find the control at all, that's
          hidden feature (Discoverability). If the control looks like
          it should do something else (wrong visual cue), that's false
          signifier (Signifiers). Arbitrary mapping is about
          unintuitive control-outcome relationships that do exist but
          aren't self-explanatory.

      - name: spatial correspondence
        definition: >
          The physical or visual arrangement of controls matches the
          arrangement of the things they affect — position communicates
          function.
        apply_when: >
          The participant comments on how the position of controls
          relates to the position of their effects, notes that layout
          matches physical reality, or expects controls to be near what
          they control. Look for "this slider is next to the thing it
          changes," "the buttons are in the same order as the tabs."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is commenting on the overall layout being
          logical without reference to a control-outcome spatial
          relationship, that's logical layout. If the comment is about
          a control being intuitive to use (not its position), that's
          natural mapping. Spatial correspondence is specifically about
          position-based relationships.

      - name: logical layout
        definition: >
          The overall organisation of the interface follows a logical
          structure that helps the participant understand and navigate —
          grouping, ordering, and hierarchy make sense.
        apply_when: >
          The participant comments on the grouping, ordering, or
          overall structure of the interface. Look for "it's organised
          well," "these are grouped logically," "the order makes sense,"
          "I'd expect these together."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is commenting on a specific control-outcome
          relationship, that's natural mapping or arbitrary mapping. If
          the comment is about controls being positioned near what they
          control, that's spatial correspondence. Logical layout is about
          the broader organisational structure, not specific control
          mappings.

    colour_set: ux
    tags:
      - name: physical constraint
        definition: >
          A physical property of the design that prevents incorrect
          actions — something that simply can't be done wrong because
          the physical form doesn't allow it.
        apply_when: >
          The participant encounters something that physically prevents
          a wrong action: a disabled button, a greyed-out option, a
          form field that only accepts numbers. Look for "it won't let
          me," "the button is greyed out," "I can't type letters here."
        not_this: >
          If the constraint is about social norms (e.g. not wanting to
          click something labelled "admin"), that's cultural constraint.
          If the constraint is about what makes logical sense given the
          context, that's semantic or logical constraint. Physical
          constraint is about the literal inability to perform an action.

      - name: cultural constraint
        definition: >
          A convention or social norm that guides the participant's
          behaviour — they do (or avoid) something because of learned
          cultural expectations, not because the system enforces it.
        apply_when: >
          The participant follows or references social conventions,
          expectations from their culture, or norms about how things
          should work. Look for "you're supposed to," "it's rude to,"
          "normally you would," "people expect," "in my country."

          If the participant is applying learned behaviour from other
          products (not cultural norms), that's learned behaviour
          (Conceptual model). If the system physically prevents the
          action, that's physical constraint. Cultural constraint is
          about social/cultural expectations, not product conventions
          or system enforcement.

      - name: semantic constraint
        definition: >
          The meaning of a situation constrains what actions make sense —
          the participant knows what to do because the context gives
          meaning to the available options.
        apply_when: >
          The participant uses contextual meaning to guide their
          actions: they know which field is for the address because of
          the label, or they know the red button is for deletion because
          red means danger. Look for "obviously this is for," "it makes
          sense that this means," "the label tells me."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is commenting on a visual signifier
          (underline = link, button shape = clickable), that's
          affordance or perceived affordance (Signifiers). If the
          constraint comes from the logical structure of the task
          (step 1 before step 2), that's logical constraint. Semantic
          constraint is about meaning-based guidance, not visual cues
          or sequential logic.

      - name: logical constraint
        definition: >
          The logical structure of the task or the system makes certain
          actions the only reasonable option — the participant is guided
          by elimination or sequential logic.
        apply_when: >
          The participant follows a logical sequence, eliminates options
          through reasoning, or notes that the flow enforces an order.
          Look for "the only option left is," "I have to do this
          before that," "it makes me go step by step," "process of
          elimination."
        not_this: >
          If the system physically prevents out-of-order actions, that's
          physical constraint. If the participant uses the meaning of
          labels to guide their choice, that's semantic constraint.
          Logical constraint is about reasoning-based guidance — the
          participant figures out the right action through logic, not
          because the system blocks alternatives or because labels
          explain what to do.

      - name: action slip
        definition: >
          The participant intended the right action but executed it
          wrong — a motor error, a misclick, selecting the adjacent
          item, or a slip of the finger on a touch target.
        apply_when: >
          The participant makes a mechanical error: clicks the wrong
          button, taps the wrong item, types a typo, or performs the
          right action on the wrong object. They immediately recognise
          the error. Look for "oops, wrong one," "I meant to click
          that one," "my finger slipped," "I didn't mean to do that."
        not_this: >
          If the participant forgot to do something, that's memory
          lapse. If they deliberately chose the wrong action because
          they misunderstood the system, that's rule-based mistake or
          knowledge-based mistake. Action slip is about correct
          intention, incorrect execution — the participant knows what
          they wanted to do.

      - name: memory lapse
        definition: >
          The participant forgot to do something, lost track of where
          they were, or failed to remember a step in a process — a
          failure of working memory, not of understanding.
        apply_when: >
          The participant forgets a step, loses their place, can't
          remember what they were doing, or has to go back because they
          missed something. Look for "I forgot to," "wait, where was I,"
          "I need to go back because I missed," "what was I supposed
          to do next."
        not_this: >
          If the participant doesn't know the step exists (never learned
          it), that's a knowledge-based mistake, not a memory lapse.
          If they remember the goal but executed wrong (misclick), that's
          action slip. Memory lapse is specifically about forgetting
          something previously known or currently in working memory.

      - name: rule-based mistake
        definition: >
          The participant applied a known rule or convention incorrectly —
          they had a plan but chose the wrong one because they
          misidentified the situation or applied the wrong procedure.
        apply_when: >
          The participant follows a procedure that doesn't work because
          it's the wrong procedure for this situation, or applies a
          rule from another context that doesn't apply here. Look for
          "I thought you had to," "usually you do it this way," "that's
          how it works in [other product]," "I followed the same steps
          but it didn't work."
        not_this: >
          If the participant has no relevant prior knowledge and is
          guessing, that's knowledge-based mistake. If they applied the
          right rule but misexecuted it (pressed wrong button), that's
          action slip. If they're describing expectations from other
          products without making an error, that's learned behaviour
          (Conceptual model). Rule-based mistake requires the
          participant to apply a known-but-wrong procedure.

      - name: knowledge-based mistake
        definition: >
          The participant lacks the knowledge needed to accomplish their
          goal — they don't understand the system well enough to form a
          correct plan, so they reason from incomplete information.
        apply_when: >
          The participant is clearly guessing, trying random things
          without understanding, or reveals fundamental
          misunderstanding of the system. Look for "I have no idea how
          to," "I'm just guessing," "I don't understand what this is,"
          "I don't know what any of these mean."
        not_this: >
          If the participant has a plan but it's the wrong plan (wrong
          rule), that's rule-based mistake. If they are deliberately
          exploring to learn, that's exploration (Discoverability), not
          an error. If they understand the system but forgot a step,
          that's memory lapse. Knowledge-based mistake is about
          fundamental lack of understanding, not forgotten knowledge or
          wrong application of known rules.
