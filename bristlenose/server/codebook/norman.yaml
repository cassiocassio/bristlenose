description: >
  Seven fundamental principles of interaction design that explain why
  products are easy or hard to use. A bottom-up framework for diagnosing
  why interactions succeed or fail — from whether users can discover
  what's possible (Discoverability) to whether the system communicates
  what happened (Feedback) to whether errors are slips or mistakes.

preamble: >
  The following tags describe principles of interaction design. They
  describe the relationship between a person and a designed thing — how
  the design communicates what's possible, what's happening, and what
  went wrong. These tags apply to designed products, interfaces, and
  services. If the participant is describing personal experiences,
  physical activities, domain expertise, or life context without
  reference to a designed artefact, do not apply any tag from this
  codebook. Do not stretch these concepts metaphorically — "feedback"
  means a designed system communicating the result of an action, not any
  situation where a person learns something from their environment.
