title: Platonic Ontology & Epistemology
author: Composite — Vlastos, Fine, Kraut, Sedley
enabled: true

description: >
  A scholarly codebook for analysing Plato's dialogues through the lens of his
  ontology (Theory of Forms, cosmology, soul) and epistemology (knowledge vs
  opinion, dialectic, recollection). Tags are grounded in the major themes
  identified by leading Plato scholars: Gregory Vlastos, Gail Fine, Richard
  Kraut, David Sedley, and Terence Irwin. Designed for tagging philosophical
  arguments, not product interfaces — expect passages about justice, beauty,
  and the nature of reality rather than buttons and navigation.

author_bio: >
  Composite framework drawing on Gregory Vlastos (Socratic elenchus, irony),
  Gail Fine (epistemology, Forms), Richard Kraut (ethics, Republic), David
  Sedley (cosmology, Theaetetus), and Terence Irwin (Plato's ethics and moral
  psychology). These scholars represent the dominant Anglo-American tradition
  of Plato interpretation from the late 20th century onward.

preamble: >
  The following tags describe concepts from Plato's philosophical system as
  identified by major Plato scholars. These are dialogues, not product
  interviews — the "quotes" are philosophical arguments, questions, and
  positions. When a passage could fit multiple tags, choose the tag that best
  describes the primary philosophical move being made. If a passage is purely
  dramatic or scene-setting with no philosophical content, assign the closest
  tag with low confidence. Plato's dialogues are layered — a single passage
  may demonstrate dialectic method while also advancing a claim about Forms.
  Prefer the substantive philosophical claim over the methodological wrapper.

    tags:
      - name: participation
        definition: >
          How particulars relate to Forms — the metaphysical connection
          (methexis, "sharing in") by which sensible things derive their
          properties from the Forms they instantiate.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker discusses how a particular thing is beautiful, just, or
          equal by virtue of its relationship to a Form. Look for "partakes
          of," "shares in," "by virtue of the beautiful itself," or any claim
          that a particular has a property because of its relation to an
          abstract entity.
        not_this: >
          If the speaker is arguing that Forms exist independently of
          particulars without discussing the relation, that is separation.
          If the speaker is discussing the Form's own properties, that is
          self-predication. Participation is specifically about the bridge
          between the sensible and intelligible worlds.

      - name: separation
        definition: >
          The claim that Forms exist independently of the physical world
          (chorismos) — they are not in things, not mental concepts, but
          self-subsisting realities in an intelligible realm.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker asserts or implies that Forms exist apart from sensible
          things, that they are "themselves by themselves," or that the
          intelligible realm is distinct from the visible. Look for "the
          beautiful itself," "apart from," "in another place," "separate
          from the things that partake."
        not_this: >
          If the speaker is discussing how particulars connect to Forms,
          that is participation. If they are comparing knowledge of Forms
          to opinion about sensibles, that is objects of knowledge.
          Separation is the ontological independence claim, not the
          epistemic or relational one.

      - name: self-predication
        definition: >
          The claim that the Form of F is itself F — the Form of Beauty
          is beautiful, the Form of Largeness is large. A key assumption
          in Plato's metaphysics that generates the Third Man problem.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker attributes to a Form the very property it is the
          Form of. Look for "the beautiful is beautiful," "justice itself
          is just," or passages where a Form is described as a perfect
          exemplar of the property it represents.
        not_this: >
          If the speaker is discussing the regress problem that arises
          from self-predication, that is third man argument. If they are
          discussing the Form as a cause of properties in particulars,
          that is participation. Self-predication is about the Form's
          own nature, not its causal role or logical consequences.

      - name: third man argument
        definition: >
          The infinite regress objection to the Theory of Forms — if large
          things are large by partaking in the Form of Largeness, and the
          Form of Largeness is itself large, then a further Form is needed
          to explain what the original things and the Form have in common,
          and so on ad infinitum.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker raises or responds to an infinite regress in the
          Theory of Forms, or argues that the relation between Forms and
          particulars generates an unacceptable multiplication of entities.
          This argument appears explicitly in the Parmenides.
        not_this: >
          If the speaker simply asserts that Forms are self-predicating
          without raising the regress, that is self-predication. If they
          are discussing other objections to Forms (e.g. the extent
          problem), look at the specific argument structure — Third Man
          is specifically the infinite regress.

      - name: form of the good
        definition: >
          The supreme Form in Plato's ontological hierarchy — the Form
          of the Good gives being, intelligibility, and truth to all
          other Forms, as the sun gives light and life to the visible
          world. Central to Republic Books 6–7.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker discusses a highest principle that grounds all
          reality and knowledge, the sun analogy, the Divided Line's
          uppermost segment, or the philosopher's ascent to knowledge
          of the Good. Look for "the good itself," "beyond being,"
          "the cause of knowledge and truth," "the sun analogy."
        not_this: >
          If the speaker is discussing what is good for a person (virtue,
          happiness), that is ethics and virtue territory. If they discuss
          the philosopher's special access to this knowledge, that is
          philosopher's knowledge. Form of the Good is about the
          metaphysical summit, not practical ethics.

    subtitle: What can be known, how, and what falls short of knowledge?
    colour_set: trust
    tags:
      - name: episteme vs doxa
        definition: >
          The fundamental distinction between knowledge (episteme) and
          mere belief or opinion (doxa). Knowledge is stable, justified,
          and directed at what truly is; opinion is unstable, unjustified,
          and directed at the changeable sensible world.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker contrasts knowledge with belief, argues that
          perception or opinion falls short of genuine understanding,
          or asserts that most people have opinions but not knowledge.
          Look for "know vs think," "knowledge vs opinion," "true
          knowledge," "mere belief."
        not_this: >
          If the speaker is specifically defining knowledge as true
          belief with an account, that is justified true belief. If
          they are discussing what objects knowledge is directed at
          (Forms vs sensibles), that is objects of knowledge. Episteme
          vs doxa is the general distinction, not the specific analysis.

      - name: justified true belief
        definition: >
          The analysis of knowledge as true opinion accompanied by a
          rational account (logos). Explored and ultimately problematised
          in the Theaetetus and Meno — can an account of what makes
          true belief into knowledge actually be given?
        apply_when: >
          The speaker defines, analyses, or critiques the claim that
          knowledge is true belief plus an account. Look for "true
          opinion with an account," "logos," "what makes belief into
          knowledge," or the Theaetetus's final definition attempts.
        not_this: >
          If the speaker simply contrasts knowledge and opinion without
          analysing the conditions, that is episteme vs doxa. If they
          argue knowledge comes from recollecting innate truths, that
          is recollection. JTB is the analytical project of specifying
          necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge.

      - name: recollection
        definition: >
          The doctrine of anamnesis — learning is not acquiring new
          information but recovering knowledge the soul possessed before
          birth. The soul, having existed before embodiment, has seen
          the Forms and needs only the right prompting to remember them.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker argues that learning is remembering, that the
          soul has prior knowledge, or demonstrates this through
          eliciting correct answers from someone who has not been
          taught (the slave boy in the Meno). Look for "recollection,"
          "the soul is immortal and has learned everything," "we do
          not learn but remember."
        not_this: >
          If the speaker argues the soul is immortal without connecting
          this to learning, that is immortality of soul. If they discuss
          the soul's prenatal vision of Forms as part of transmigration
          rather than epistemology, that is transmigration. Recollection
          is specifically about the epistemic consequence — we already
          know, we just need to be reminded.

      - name: objects of knowledge
        definition: >
          What knowledge and opinion are directed at — Forms are the
          objects of knowledge (stable, eternal, fully real), while
          sensible particulars are objects of opinion (changing, partly
          real). Grounded in the ontological distinction between the
          intelligible and visible realms.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker argues that only Forms can be truly known, that
          the sensible world is merely opined, or draws the Divided
          Line distinction between levels of reality and corresponding
          cognitive states. Look for "visible vs intelligible," "what
          fully is vs what both is and is not," "the Divided Line."
        not_this: >
          If the speaker is discussing the general knowledge/opinion
          contrast without specifying objects, that is episteme vs doxa.
          If they are discussing the Form of the Good as the supreme
          knowable, that is form of the good. Objects of knowledge
          is about the correlation between ontological status and
          epistemic access.

      - name: philosopher's knowledge
        definition: >
          The unique cognitive access that philosophers (and especially
          the philosopher-king) have to reality — through dialectic,
          they ascend from shadows to Forms, achieving a vision of
          truth unavailable to non-philosophers.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker argues that philosophers alone can know reality,
          that philosophical training (the educational programme of
          the Republic) is necessary for genuine knowledge, or that
          rulers must be philosophers because only they see the truth.
          Look for "philosophers see," "the cave," "those who love
          wisdom," "ascending to the good."
        not_this: >
          If the speaker is describing the ascent as a metaphor for
          the ontological structure (Divided Line), that is objects
          of knowledge. If they are discussing the dialectical method
          itself, that is elenchus or hypothesis method. Philosopher's
          knowledge is about the person and their privilege, not the
          method or the ontology.

  # Dialectic Method — how Socratic/Platonic philosophy proceeds
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------
  - name: Dialectic Method
    subtitle: What philosophical methods does Socrates employ?
    colour_set: task
    tags:
      - name: elenchus
        definition: >
          The Socratic method of cross-examination — Socrates elicits
          a thesis from his interlocutor, then shows through questioning
          that it leads to contradiction. The goal is to expose false
          beliefs and clear the way for genuine inquiry.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker tests a claim by drawing out its logical
          consequences and showing they contradict the original thesis
          or other beliefs the interlocutor holds. Look for "do you
          agree that," "but you also said," "then it follows," or
          any passage where Socrates leads someone to contradict
          themselves through a chain of agreed premises.
        not_this: >
          If the speaker posits a hypothesis and explores its
          consequences without targeting a specific interlocutor's
          belief, that is hypothesis method. If the result is a
          deliberate reduction to absurdity of someone else's position,
          that is reductio ad absurdum. Elenchus is the interactive,
          person-directed refutation through agreed premises.

      - name: hypothesis method
        definition: >
          The method of positing a conditional premise ("if X, then Y")
          and exploring its consequences — testing whether the
          hypothesis is consistent with known truths and with other
          hypotheses. Used in the Meno, Phaedo, and Republic.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker explicitly proposes a hypothesis to test, works
          out its implications, or evaluates it by checking consistency
          with other accepted beliefs. Look for "let us assume," "if
          virtue is knowledge, then," "hypothesising that," or passages
          where a conditional framework structures the argument.
        not_this: >
          If the speaker is directly refuting an interlocutor's stated
          belief, that is elenchus. If they are using an analogy or
          myth to explain rather than test, that is myth and analogy.
          Hypothesis method is the conditional, systematic exploration
          of what follows if something is true.

      - name: collection and division
        definition: >
          The later Platonic method (diairesis) of defining a concept
          by first collecting instances under a genus, then dividing
          the genus into species by successive binary distinctions
          until the target concept is isolated. Central to the
          Sophist, Statesman, and Phaedrus.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker classifies, groups, or divides concepts into
          kinds, or argues that correct definition requires systematic
          division of a genus. Look for "dividing at the natural
          joints," "two kinds of," "what genus does X fall under,"
          or any systematic taxonomy of concepts.
        not_this: >
          If the speaker is testing a definition through refutation,
          that is elenchus. If they use a model or analogy to
          illuminate rather than classify, that is myth and analogy.
          Collection and division is the taxonomic method of definition
          through systematic classification.

      - name: myth and analogy
        definition: >
          Non-argumentative modes of philosophical explanation — myths
          (the allegory of the cave, the chariot of the soul, the
          eschatological myths), analogies (the sun, the divided line,
          the allegory of the allegory), and thought experiments used
          to make abstract claims vivid and accessible.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker tells a story, draws an extended comparison,
          or constructs a vivid image to convey a philosophical
          point rather than arguing for it deductively. Look for "let
          me tell you a story," "imagine," "it is like," "allegory,"
          "allegory," or any passage that is clearly figurative rather
          than literal philosophical argument.
        not_this: >
          If the speaker uses a brief comparison within a deductive
          argument, that is part of whatever argument is being made.
          If the myth specifically concerns the soul's journey after
          death, consider transmigration. Myth and analogy is about
          the mode of expression — philosophy through image rather
          than through syllogism.

        definition: >
          Arguments that the soul (psyche) survives the death of the
          body — it existed before birth and will exist after death.
          Multiple arguments are given across the dialogues: the
          argument from opposites, the affinity argument, the argument
          from recollection, and the final argument in the Phaedo.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker argues for or discusses the soul's survival of
          bodily death, its pre-existence, or its indestructibility.
          Look for "the soul does not perish," "before we were born,"
          "the soul is akin to the eternal," or any argument that
          death is not the end of the soul.
        not_this: >
          If the discussion of the soul's pre-existence is specifically
          about how it grounds learning, that is recollection. If the
          soul's journey through multiple lives is the focus, that is
          transmigration. Immortality of soul is the bare survival
          claim and the arguments for it.

      - name: tripartite soul
        definition: >
          The division of the soul into three parts: reason (logistikon),
          spirit (thumoeides), and appetite (epithumetikon). Each part
          has its own desires and motivations. Central to Republic
          Book 4 and the Phaedrus chariot image.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker distinguishes parts or aspects of the soul,
          discusses conflict between reason and desire, or argues
          that different psychological drives correspond to different
          soul-parts. Look for "the rational part," "spirit," "the
          desiring part," "the soul has three parts," or the chariot
          analogy (charioteer, noble horse, base horse).
        not_this: >
          If the speaker discusses the proper ordering of these parts
          as justice, that is psychic harmony. If they discuss the
          soul's survival rather than its structure, that is immortality
          of soul. Tripartite soul is the structural claim about
          psychological complexity.

      - name: psychic harmony
        definition: >
          Justice in the individual as the proper ordering of the
          soul's parts — reason rules, spirit supports reason, and
          appetite obeys. Each part performs its own function and
          does not interfere with the others. The psychological
          analogue of justice in the city.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker defines justice or virtue as a state of the
          soul in which each part performs its proper function, or
          argues that happiness requires inner harmony. Look for "each
          part doing its own," "reason ruling," "the just soul," or
          the city-soul analogy applied to individual psychology.
        not_this: >
          If the speaker is identifying the three parts without
          discussing their ordering, that is tripartite soul. If
          they are discussing political justice (the city) rather
          than psychological justice, that is closer to piety and
          justice. Psychic harmony is the normative claim about how
          the soul should be ordered.

      - name: transmigration
        definition: >
          The soul's journey through multiple incarnations — after
          death, the soul is judged and reborn in a new body (human,
          animal, or divine) according to the life it has lived.
          Described in myths in the Phaedo, Phaedrus, and Republic.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker describes the soul's journey after death, its
          judgement, its rebirth in a new form, or the cosmic cycle
          of incarnation. Look for "choosing a new life," "born
          again," "the soul descends," or eschatological myth
          passages.
        not_this: >
          If the speaker is arguing for bare survival after death
          without the reincarnation narrative, that is immortality
          of soul. If the soul's prior existence is invoked to explain
          knowledge, that is recollection. Transmigration is the
          narrative of the soul's cosmic journey through lives.

        definition: >
          The Socratic thesis that the virtues (courage, temperance,
          justice, piety, wisdom) are all one — either identical or
          so closely connected that possessing one requires possessing
          all. Explored in the Protagoras, Laches, and Meno.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker argues that the virtues are identical, inseparable,
          or reducible to knowledge, or asks whether one can have one
          virtue without the others. Look for "are the virtues one or
          many," "courage is wisdom," "all virtue is knowledge," or
          discussions of how the specific virtues relate.
        not_this: >
          If the speaker is arguing specifically that virtue is
          knowledge (the identification with knowledge rather than the
          unity claim), that is virtue as knowledge. If they are
          defining a specific virtue (piety, justice) rather than
          discussing their unity, that is piety and justice. Unity
          of virtue is about the structural claim that the virtues
          form a system.

        definition: >
          The Socratic intellectualist thesis that virtue is a form of
          knowledge — no one does wrong willingly, because to know the
          good is to do the good. Vice is always ignorance. This
          entails the denial of akrasia (weakness of will).

          The speaker argues that wrongdoing is involuntary, that
          virtue is teachable (because it is knowledge), or that no
          one errs knowingly. Look for "no one does wrong willingly,"
          "virtue is teachable," "if he knew the good he would do it,"
          or discussions of whether akrasia is possible.
        not_this: >
          If the speaker is discussing the unity of the virtues as a
          system rather than their identity with knowledge, that is
          unity of virtue. If they are discussing the philosopher's
          special knowledge of the Good, that is philosopher's
          knowledge. Virtue as knowledge is the motivational thesis
          that knowing automatically produces doing.

      - name: the examined life
        definition: >
          Socrates' famous dictum that "the unexamined life is not
          worth living" — the claim that philosophical self-scrutiny
          is essential to a good human life, and that most people
          live unexamined, unreflective lives.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker argues for the importance of self-examination,
          philosophical inquiry as a way of life, or criticises those
          who live without questioning their beliefs and values. Look
          for "the unexamined life," "I must continue to question,"
          "testing myself and others," or defenses of the philosophical
          life.
        not_this: >
          If the speaker is conducting an elenchus (actually examining
          someone), that is elenchus. If they are arguing for the
          philosopher's political authority, that is philosopher's
          knowledge. The examined life is the value claim about
          philosophical reflection as essential to human flourishing.

      - name: piety and justice
        definition: >
          The relationship between religious obligation (piety, to
          hosion) and moral obligation (justice, to dikaion) — is
          what is pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or
          pious because it is loved by the gods? Central to the
          Euthyphro dilemma and to the Republic's redefinition of
          justice.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker discusses the nature of piety, its relation to
          justice, the Euthyphro dilemma (divine command vs independent
          moral truth), or definitions of justice at either the
          individual or political level. Look for "what is piety,"
          "what is justice," "god-loved," "doing one's own," or
          attempts to define these central moral concepts.
        not_this: >
          If the speaker is discussing inner psychological harmony as
          justice, that is psychic harmony. If they are discussing
          the soul's moral development across lives, that is
          transmigration. Piety and justice is about the definitional
          and conceptual analysis of these moral terms.

  # Argumentation & Irony — how Socrates conducts himself
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------
  - name: Argumentation & Irony
    subtitle: What rhetorical and argumentative moves does Socrates make?
    colour_set: task
    tags:
      - name: socratic irony
        definition: >
          Socrates' characteristic stance of professing ignorance while
          being the wisest person in the room — he claims to know
          nothing while systematically demolishing the knowledge claims
          of others. Vlastos's "complex irony": Socrates means and
          does not mean what he says simultaneously.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker professes ignorance, disclaims expertise, or
          inverts the expected teacher-student dynamic while clearly
          guiding the conversation toward philosophical truth. Look
          for "I know that I know nothing," "you are the wise one,"
          "teach me," "I am only asking," or any passage where
          Socrates' modesty is clearly strategic.
        not_this: >
          If the speaker is genuinely puzzled (not strategically
          modest), the passage may end in aporia rather than irony.
          If the speaker is conducting a refutation, that is elenchus.
          Socratic irony is the persona — the stance of performed
          ignorance — not the argumentative method itself.

      - name: reductio ad absurdum
        definition: >
          Showing that a position is false by deriving an absurd or
          contradictory consequence from it — if your thesis leads
          to impossibility, the thesis must be rejected. A core
          tool of Socratic argumentation.
        apply_when: >
          The speaker takes an opponent's premise and systematically
          derives a conclusion that is obviously false, contradictory,
          or unacceptable, thereby refuting the premise. Look for
          "but then it would follow that," "which is absurd," "which
          contradicts what you said," or chains of reasoning that
          end in manifest impossibility.
        not_this: >
          If the refutation proceeds by showing inconsistency among
          the interlocutor's own beliefs (rather than deriving an
          independent absurdity), that is elenchus. If the passage
          ends in irresolution rather than refutation, that is aporia.
          Reductio is the specific logical move of deriving absurdity
          from a premise.

      - name: aporia
        definition: >
          The productive impasse — a dialogue ending (or reaching a
          turning point) where the interlocutors acknowledge that they
          cannot answer the question they set out to investigate.
          Characteristic of the early "Socratic" dialogues (Euthyphro,
          Laches, Charmides). Vlastos argues aporia is itself a
          philosophical achievement, not a failure.
        apply_when: >
          The speakers acknowledge that the inquiry has reached an
          impasse, that the question remains unanswered, or that all
          proposed definitions have failed. Look for "we are no
          further than when we began," "I am at a loss," "we must
          start again," or endings where no conclusion is reached.
        not_this: >
          If the speaker merely professes ignorance as a stance, that
          is socratic irony. If the argument successfully refutes a
          position (not leaving an impasse but establishing a
          negative result), that is reductio ad absurdum or elenchus.
          Aporia is the state of genuine puzzlement after inquiry.

      - name: interlocutor concession
        definition: >
          A moment where the respondent is led to agree with a
          proposition that contradicts or undermines their original
          position — the conversational mechanism by which Socratic
          arguments advance. Each concession becomes a new premise.
        apply_when: >
          The respondent explicitly agrees ("yes," "it must be so,"
          "I suppose"), especially when the agreement moves them away
          from their initial thesis. Look for reluctant or surprised
          agreement, acknowledgements that follow Socratic questioning,
          or passages where the interlocutor is clearly being guided
          step by step to a conclusion they did not anticipate.
        not_this: >
          If the agreement is enthusiastic and the interlocutor
          already holds the view, it is not a concession but a shared
          premise. If the passage describes the final impasse rather
          than a step-by-step progression, that is aporia. Interlocutor
          concession is the micro-level agreement that drives the
          argument forward.
