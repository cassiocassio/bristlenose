description: >
  A domain-agnostic codebook for any user research study. Ten theme
  categories that emerge bottom-up from behavioural observation,
  emotional response, and contextual analysis. Works equally well
  whether the research is about fishkeeping, rock climbing, poodle
  grooming, or product evaluation — these are universal patterns of
  human experience, motivation, and interaction.

author_bio: >
  This is the default codebook — it provides a general-purpose
  qualitative coding framework that applies to any domain. Unlike the
  Research Leaders codebooks (Garrett, Norman, Morville), which focus
  on designed artefacts and UX-specific concepts, these ten categories
  capture the full range of human experience themes that emerge in
  qualitative research.
