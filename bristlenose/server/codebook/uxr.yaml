description: >
  A practitioner-oriented codebook for any user research study. Eight
  theme groups covering behaviour, pain points, needs, mental models,
  motivation, emotion, context, and learning. Domain-agnostic — works
  equally well for fishkeeping, fintech, healthcare, or rock climbing.
  These are universal patterns of human experience that emerge in
  qualitative research across any domain.

author_bio: >
  This is the default codebook — it provides a general-purpose
  qualitative coding framework that applies to any domain. Unlike the
  Research Leaders codebooks (Garrett, Norman), which focus on designed
  artefacts and specific interaction-design theories, these tags
  reflect the practical vocabulary used by working UX researchers on
  sticky notes, in Dovetail, and in affinity diagrams.

preamble: >
  These tags describe patterns of human experience, behaviour, and
  interaction that emerge in qualitative research across any domain.
  They are not tied to a specific design framework or theory — they
  reflect the practical vocabulary used by working researchers.
  Apply tags based on what the participant says and does in the quote.
  If no tag fits naturally, assign nothing — an untagged quote is
  better than a forced tag. When two tags could apply, choose the
  one that best describes the primary thing happening in the quote.

groups:
  - name: Behaviour
    subtitle: What people actually do
    colour_set: ux
    tags:
      - name: workaround
        definition: >
          The participant has invented their own solution because the
          intended path doesn't work for them — a self-made fix,
          shortcut, or alternative route.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes doing something "the wrong way" or
          a non-obvious way because the designed path failed them.
          Look for "what I actually do is," "I just use X instead,"
          "my trick is," "I figured out that if you."
        not_this: >
          If the participant simply avoids the feature entirely, that's
          avoidance. If they describe difficulty but haven't invented a
          solution, that's friction. Workaround requires a creative
          alternative, not just struggle.

      - name: habit
        definition: >
          The participant does something automatically, without
          deliberate thought — ingrained routine behaviour that
          persists even when better options exist.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes something they "always" do, do
          "without thinking," or have done "for years." Look for
          "I just automatically," "out of habit," "I always," "that's
          just what I do," "I don't even think about it."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is deliberately choosing to do something
          (conscious decision), that's not habit — consider goal or
          workaround. Habit is unconscious repetition, not deliberate
          strategy.

      - name: avoidance
        definition: >
          The participant deliberately steers away from a feature,
          area, or action — they know it exists but choose not to
          engage.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes something they refuse to use, skip
          over, ignore, or go out of their way to avoid. Look for
          "I never touch that," "I skip," "I don't bother with,"
          "I stay away from," "I refuse to."
        not_this: >
          If the participant doesn't know the feature exists, that's
          not avoidance — consider confusion or tag nothing. If they've
          built an alternative route, that's workaround. Avoidance is
          conscious non-engagement.

      - name: say-do gap
        definition: >
          What the participant says they do contradicts what they
          actually do — stated behaviour differs from observed
          behaviour.
        apply_when: >
          The participant's stated behaviour contradicts evidence from
          observation, other quotes, or their own earlier statements.
          Look for "I usually do X" when observation shows Y, or
          self-contradictions within the interview.
        not_this: >
          This tag requires evidence of a gap — the participant must
          both state something AND the data must show something
          different. A single statement without contradicting evidence
          isn't a say-do gap — it's just a statement.

      - name: error recovery
        definition: >
          How the participant recovers (or fails to recover) after
          making a mistake — the moment after something goes wrong.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes what happened after an error —
          hitting undo, starting over, calling support, giving up, or
          finding their own fix. Look for "so then I had to,"
          "I couldn't figure out how to go back," "I hit undo,"
          "I just started over."
        not_this: >
          If the participant hasn't made an error but is simply
          confused, that's confusion. If they gave up entirely, that's
          abandonment. Error recovery is specifically the response to
          a mistake, not the confusion that preceded it.

  - name: Pain points
    subtitle: Where things break down
    colour_set: emo
    tags:
      - name: confusion
        definition: >
          The participant doesn't understand what's happening, what
          something means, or what to do next — a cognitive "I'm lost"
          moment.
        apply_when: >
          The participant expresses uncertainty about meaning, state,
          or next steps. Look for "I don't understand," "what does this
          mean," "I'm not sure what," "where am I," "wait, what,"
          "huh?"
        not_this: >
          If the participant understands but finds the process slow or
          effortful, that's friction. If they have a wrong
          understanding (but feel confident), that's misconception.
          Confusion is the felt experience of not knowing.

      - name: frustration
        definition: >
          The participant expresses annoyance, anger, or exasperation —
          an emotional response to something that isn't working well.
        apply_when: >
          The participant shows visible or verbal signs of annoyance.
          Look for tone markers (sighing, swearing, emphatic language),
          "this is ridiculous," "why can't I just," "that's so
          annoying," "I hate when," "are you kidding me."
        not_this: >
          Frustration is an emotional state, not a usability
          observation. If the participant is calm but the process is
          slow, that's friction. If they're confused but not angry,
          that's confusion. Frustration requires emotional escalation.

      - name: friction
        definition: >
          Something slows the participant down, adds unnecessary steps,
          or requires more effort than it should — the "this is harder
          than it needs to be" feeling.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes unnecessary steps, excessive
          effort, slow processes, or things that should be easier.
          Look for "it takes too long," "too many steps," "why do I
          have to," "it should just," "every time I need to."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is emotionally escalated, that's
          frustration (friction is the observation, frustration is the
          emotional response to it). If they can't proceed at all,
          that's dead end. Friction means progress is possible but
          unnecessarily hard.

      - name: dead end
        definition: >
          The participant hits a wall with no obvious way forward —
          stuck, blocked, can't proceed.
        apply_when: >
          The participant reaches a point where they literally cannot
          continue. Look for "I can't," "there's no way to," "it won't
          let me," "I'm stuck," "now what," "nothing happens."
        not_this: >
          If the participant can proceed but it's slow or hard, that's
          friction. If they choose to give up, that's abandonment.
          Dead end is the moment of being blocked — what happens next
          (abandon, workaround, error recovery) is a separate tag.

      - name: abandonment
        definition: >
          The participant gives up on a task or goal entirely — they
          stop trying.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes quitting, leaving, giving up, or
          walking away. Look for "I just gave up," "I left,"
          "I stopped trying," "I moved on," "I went somewhere else,"
          "forget it."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is still trying but blocked, that's dead
          end. If they found an alternative route, that's workaround.
          Abandonment means they stopped pursuing the goal entirely —
          no fallback, no retry, just done.

  - name: Needs and desires
    subtitle: What people want
    colour_set: emo
    tags:
      - name: unmet need
        definition: >
          Something the participant wants or needs that isn't being
          addressed — a gap between what they have and what they
          require.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes something missing from their
          experience — not a specific feature, but an underlying need
          or desire. Look for "I wish," "what I really need is,"
          "there's nothing that," "if only," "the problem is there's
          no way to."
        not_this: >
          If the participant asks for a specific feature or capability
          by name, that's feature request. Unmet need is the
          underlying problem; feature request is a proposed solution.
          "I need better organisation" = unmet need. "I want a folder
          system" = feature request.

      - name: feature request
        definition: >
          The participant explicitly asks for a specific capability,
          feature, or improvement — a concrete "build this" statement.
        apply_when: >
          The participant names a specific thing they want built,
          added, or changed. Look for "you should add," "it would be
          great if," "I want a button that," "can you make it so,"
          "why isn't there a."
        not_this: >
          If the participant describes an underlying problem without
          proposing a solution, that's unmet need. Feature request is
          the participant's proposed solution — they may be right about
          the need but wrong about the solution. Tag the request, not
          just the need behind it.

      - name: desire path
        definition: >
          The participant's natural behaviour reveals a need the
          designer didn't anticipate — they've worn a path through the
          grass where no pavement exists.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes using something in an unintended
          way that reveals what they actually want. Look for "I use X
          for Y" (where Y isn't what X was designed for),
          cobbled-together workflows, spreadsheets used as databases,
          emails used as to-do lists.
        not_this: >
          If the participant has a deliberate fix for a known problem,
          that's workaround (conscious). Desire path is often
          unselfconscious — the participant may not even realise
          they're revealing a need. The distinction: workaround =
          "I know this is wrong but"; desire path = "this is just how
          I do it."

      - name: expectation mismatch
        definition: >
          What the participant expected to happen differs from what
          actually happened — surprise, disappointment, or confusion
          caused by a gap between mental model and reality.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes something that didn't behave as
          they expected. Look for "I thought it would," "I expected,"
          "I assumed," "that's not what I thought would happen,"
          "I was surprised that," "why did it."
        not_this: >
          If the participant reveals their overall understanding of a
          system, that's mental model (neutral). If they have a
          factually wrong belief, that's misconception. Expectation
          mismatch is specifically about a moment of surprise when
          prediction meets reality.

  - name: Mental models
    subtitle: How people think it works
    colour_set: task
    tags:
      - name: mental model
        definition: >
          The participant reveals how they conceptualise a system,
          process, or domain — their internal map of how things work
          or are organised.
        apply_when: >
          The participant explains their understanding of how something
          is structured, categorised, or operates. Look for "the way
          I think about it is," "I see it as," "in my mind," "it's
          like," analogies, or descriptions of how they believe a
          process works.
        not_this: >
          If the participant's model is factually wrong, that's
          misconception (a subset). If they're comparing to past
          experience, that's prior experience. Mental model is the
          neutral act of revealing how they think — right or wrong.

      - name: assumption
        definition: >
          The participant takes something for granted that may or may
          not be true — an unexamined belief that shapes their
          behaviour.
        apply_when: >
          The participant acts on or states an unverified belief. Look
          for "I assumed," "I figured," "I thought it was obvious
          that," "of course it would," "everyone knows that,"
          "surely."
        not_this: >
          If the assumption is definitively wrong, consider
          misconception. If the participant is actively comparing to
          past experience, that's prior experience. Assumption is
          about unstated, often unconscious premises.

      - name: prior experience
        definition: >
          The participant references a previous experience — with
          another product, system, or context — that shapes their
          current expectations.
        apply_when: >
          The participant explicitly references another product, a
          previous version, a competitor, or a past situation. Look
          for "at my old job," "on [other product]," "last time I,"
          "the way [competitor] does it," "I'm used to."
        not_this: >
          If the participant reveals an internal model without
          referencing a specific past experience, that's mental model.
          Prior experience requires an explicit reference to a concrete
          past situation, product, or context.

      - name: misconception
        definition: >
          The participant has a factually incorrect understanding that
          they believe to be true — a wrong mental model they're
          acting on.
        apply_when: >
          The participant states or acts on something that is
          demonstrably wrong. Look for confident statements that
          contradict how the system actually works, incorrect
          explanations of cause and effect, or wrong beliefs about
          what will happen.
        not_this: >
          If the participant is uncertain (knows they don't know),
          that's confusion. If their model is simply different but not
          wrong, that's mental model. Misconception requires the
          participant to be wrong and confident — they think they know.

  - name: Motivation
    subtitle: Why people bother
    colour_set: task
    tags:
      - name: goal
        definition: >
          What the participant is trying to achieve — the outcome
          they're working toward in this moment or overall.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes what they want to accomplish. Look
          for "I'm trying to," "my goal is," "I want to," "I need to
          get," "the whole point is."
        not_this: >
          If the participant describes what prompted them to start,
          that's trigger. If they describe what's stopping them, that's
          barrier. Goal is the destination; trigger is what got them
          moving; barrier is what's in the way.

      - name: trigger
        definition: >
          What prompted the participant to take action — the event,
          realisation, or external push that started the journey.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes the moment or event that made them
          act. Look for "that's when I decided," "what made me start
          was," "the last straw was," "I saw an ad," "someone
          recommended," "I finally."
        not_this: >
          If the participant describes an ongoing goal rather than the
          moment that initiated action, that's goal. Trigger is about
          the precipitating event, not the underlying motivation.

      - name: barrier
        definition: >
          Something preventing the participant from reaching their
          goal — an obstacle, constraint, or blocker that sits between
          them and the outcome they want.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes what's stopping them or making
          progress difficult. Look for "the problem is," "I can't
          because," "what holds me back is," "the thing that stops
          me," "if it weren't for."
        not_this: >
          If the obstacle is a specific usability issue, consider
          friction or dead end (those describe the experience of
          hitting the barrier). Barrier is the structural or
          contextual constraint itself — cost, time, access,
          knowledge, regulations.

      - name: job-to-be-done
        definition: >
          The underlying job the participant is "hiring" a product or
          process to accomplish — the deeper motivation beneath the
          surface goal, incorporating functional, social, and
          emotional dimensions.
        apply_when: >
          The participant reveals the deeper purpose behind their
          actions — the "why behind the why." Look for statements
          that reveal functional needs ("I need to get this done"),
          social needs ("I want to look professional"), or emotional
          needs ("I want to feel in control").
        not_this: >
          If the participant describes a specific, immediate task,
          that's goal (tactical). Job-to-be-done is strategic — it's
          the enduring life need that exists independent of any
          particular product. "Find a restaurant" = goal. "Feed my
          family reliably without stress" = job-to-be-done.

  - name: Emotion and trust
    subtitle: How people feel
    colour_set: trust
    tags:
      - name: delight
        definition: >
          The participant expresses genuine pleasure, joy, or positive
          surprise — a moment that exceeds expectations.
        apply_when: >
          The participant shows or states positive emotion — genuine
          pleasure, not mere satisfaction. Look for "I love," "that's
          amazing," "oh cool," "this is great," laughing with
          pleasure, "I didn't expect that" (positively).
        not_this: >
          If the participant is satisfied but not emotionally moved,
          don't tag — delight requires elevated positive emotion. If
          the surprise is negative, that's surprise (neutral tag).
          Delight is specifically positive emotional response beyond
          basic satisfaction.

      - name: anxiety
        definition: >
          The participant feels uncertain, worried, or nervous about
          an outcome — anticipatory stress about what might go wrong.
        apply_when: >
          The participant expresses worry about a future outcome or
          current uncertainty. Look for "I'm worried that," "what if,"
          "I'm not sure this will," "I hope it doesn't," "I'm nervous
          about," hesitation before committing.
        not_this: >
          If the participant lacks trust in a specific entity, that's
          distrust. If they're confused about what's happening, that's
          confusion. Anxiety is forward-looking emotional unease —
          worry about what might happen, not confusion about what is
          happening.

      - name: trust
        definition: >
          The participant expresses confidence, belief, or reliance on
          a system, person, brand, or process — a positive judgement
          of reliability or credibility.
        apply_when: >
          The participant signals confidence or positive reliance.
          Look for "I trust," "I know they'll," "I feel safe,"
          "they're reliable," "I believe," "I'm confident that,"
          "I don't worry about."
        not_this: >
          If the participant has a generic positive emotional response,
          that's delight. Trust is specifically about credibility,
          reliability, and confidence in outcomes — a cognitive
          judgement, not just a feeling.

      - name: distrust
        definition: >
          The participant expresses suspicion, scepticism, or lack of
          confidence — a negative judgement about reliability, honesty,
          or competence.
        apply_when: >
          The participant signals suspicion or active disbelief. Look
          for "I don't trust," "that seems dodgy," "I'm suspicious,"
          "are they going to," "I bet they," "that feels like a scam,"
          "why do they need my."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is worried about a future outcome, that's
          anxiety (forward-looking). Distrust is a judgement about an
          entity's character or reliability — "they can't be trusted"
          vs "I'm worried about what might happen."

      - name: surprise
        definition: >
          Something unexpected happened — could be positive, negative,
          or neutral. The participant's expectations were violated.
        apply_when: >
          The participant encounters something they didn't expect. Look
          for "oh!," "I didn't expect," "I was surprised," "really?,"
          "wait, what?," "that's weird," "huh, I didn't know."
        not_this: >
          If the surprise is clearly positive and emotionally elevated,
          that's delight. If the surprise reveals a gap between
          expectation and reality, that's expectation mismatch. Use
          surprise when the emotional valence is unclear or mixed, or
          the reaction is brief.

      - name: interruption
        definition: >
          External factors pull the participant away from their task —
          the context intrudes on the experience.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes being pulled away, distracted, or
          having their flow broken by something external. Look for
          "then my phone rang," "the kids needed me," "I got pulled
          into a meeting," "I had to stop because," "I lost my place."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is under time pressure but not
          interrupted, that's time pressure. If other people are
          influencing their decision (not interrupting), that's social
          influence. Interruption is a disruption event, not an ongoing
          condition.

      - name: time pressure
        definition: >
          The participant is constrained by urgency, deadlines, or
          limited time — the clock is a factor in their experience.
        apply_when: >
          The participant mentions deadlines, rushing, or time as a
          limiting factor. Look for "I was in a rush," "I didn't have
          time to," "the deadline was," "I needed it fast," "I
          couldn't wait," "right now."
        not_this: >
          If the participant is blocked (can't proceed at all), that's
          dead end — different from being time-constrained but able to
          proceed. Time pressure is about pace and urgency, not about
          being stuck.

      - name: social influence
        definition: >
          Other people — peers, family, experts, communities, or
          cultural norms — shape the participant's behaviour,
          decisions, or opinions.
        apply_when: >
          The participant references other people's opinions,
          recommendations, or behaviour as a factor. Look for "my
          friend told me," "everyone uses," "the reviews said,"
          "people will think," "my partner wants," "the community
          recommends."
        not_this: >
          If other people are physically interrupting the task, that's
          interruption. Social influence is about other people shaping
          the decision, not disrupting the process.

      - name: device/channel
        definition: >
          The participant references switching between devices,
          platforms, or communication channels — multi-device or
          omnichannel behaviour.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes moving between devices, platforms,
          or channels. Look for "on my phone," "then I switched to my
          laptop," "I called them instead," "I went to the store,"
          "the app vs the website."
        not_this: >
          This is a context observation, not a pain point. If
          switching devices causes frustration, also tag friction or
          frustration. Device/channel captures the behaviour of moving
          between touchpoints.

  - name: Learning

    tags:
      - name: aha moment
        definition: >
          The participant has a sudden insight or breakthrough
          understanding — the penny drops and something clicks into
          place.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes a moment of sudden understanding.
          Look for "oh! that's how it works," "now I get it,"
          "I finally figured out," "it suddenly made sense," "the
          lightbulb went on," "so THAT'S what."
        not_this: >
          If understanding came gradually through effort, that's
          learning curve (process), not aha moment (event). If the
          participant is just surprised without gaining understanding,
          that's surprise. Aha moment requires a cognitive shift — new
          understanding, not just new information.

      - name: learning curve
        definition: >
          The participant describes the process of building
          competence — the difficulty (or ease) of getting up to speed
          with something.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes the process of learning over time.
          Look for "it took me a while to," "at first I couldn't,"
          "once you learn," "the hardest part was figuring out,"
          "after a few tries," "it's not intuitive but."
        not_this: >
          If the participant has a sudden insight, that's aha moment
          (event). If they're currently confused and haven't yet
          learned, that's confusion (state). Learning curve is
          retrospective — looking back at the process of building
          competence.

      - name: self-taught
        definition: >
          The participant figured something out on their own — without
          formal training, documentation, or external help.
        apply_when: >
          The participant describes learning through trial and error,
          exploration, or improvisation. Look for "I taught myself,"
          "I just played around until," "I figured it out by,"
          "nobody showed me," "I watched YouTube videos," "I googled
          it."
        not_this: >
          If other people helped, consider social influence. If formal
          training was involved, this tag doesn't apply. Self-taught
          is specifically about autonomous learning — the participant
          as their own teacher.

      - name: expertise
        definition: >
          The participant demonstrates or references deep domain
          knowledge — they know this area well and their competence
          is evident.
        apply_when: >
          The participant shows mastery, uses domain-specific jargon
          fluently, makes nuanced distinctions, or references deep
          experience. Look for technical vocabulary used confidently,
          "in my experience," corrections of the interviewer,
          comparisons between subtle alternatives.
        not_this: >
          If the participant is learning (not yet expert), that's
          learning curve or self-taught. If they reference experience
          but aren't showing mastery, that's prior experience.
          Expertise is about demonstrated competence, not just time
          spent.
