# Active Feature Branches

This document tracks active feature branches to help multiple Claude sessions coordinate without conflicts.

**Updated:** 25 Feb 2026 (react-settings-about merged)

---

## Worktree Convention

Each active feature branch gets its own **git worktree** — a full working copy in a separate directory. This lets multiple Claude sessions work on different features simultaneously without interfering.

**Directory pattern:** `/Users/cassio/Code/bristlenose_branch <name>`

| Directory | Branch | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `bristlenose/` | `main` | Main repo, releases, hotfixes |
| `bristlenose_branch symbology/` | `symbology` | § ¶ ❋ Unicode prefix symbols for sections, quotes, themes |
| `bristlenose_branch highlighter/` | `highlighter` | Highlighter feature |
| `bristlenose_branch living-fish/` | `living-fish` | Animated "living portrait" logo for serve mode |


**Creating a new feature branch worktree:**

```bash
# From the main repo:
cd /Users/cassio/Code/bristlenose

# Create the branch (if it doesn't exist) and the worktree in one go:
git branch my-feature main
git worktree add "/Users/cassio/Code/bristlenose_branch my-feature" my-feature

# Or if the branch already exists:
git worktree add "/Users/cassio/Code/bristlenose_branch my-feature" my-feature
```

**Each worktree needs its own venv** to run tests:

```bash
cd "/Users/cassio/Code/bristlenose_branch my-feature"
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

**Listing worktrees:** `git worktree list` (from any worktree)

**Removing a worktree** (after merging to main):

**Important:** Always `cd` to the main repo *before* removing a worktree. If a Claude session or terminal has its CWD inside the worktree directory, removing it will break that shell — every subsequent command fails with "path does not exist" and the session is unrecoverable.

```bash
# 1. Switch to main repo FIRST (never remove a worktree from inside it)
cd /Users/cassio/Code/bristlenose

# 2. Remove the worktree and branch
git worktree remove "/Users/cassio/Code/bristlenose_branch my-feature"
git branch -d my-feature

# 3. If the directory was already deleted (rm -rf or Finder):
git worktree prune          # cleans stale worktree refs
git branch -d my-feature    # delete the branch

# 4. If also on remote:
git push origin --delete my-feature
```

**Rules:**
- `bristlenose/` always stays on `main` — never check out a feature branch there
- Each Claude session should confirm which worktree it's operating in at session start
- Commits made in any worktree are immediately visible to all others (shared `.git`)
- Don't run `git checkout` to switch branches inside a worktree — that defeats the point

## How to Use This File

When starting a new Claude session on a feature branch:
1. Check this file to see what other branches are active
2. Confirm you're in the right worktree directory
3. Note which files other branches are touching
4. Avoid editing those files unless necessary
5. Update this file when you create/complete a branch

When merging back to main:
1. Read the merge plan for your branch
2. Check for conflicts with other branches
3. Update this file to mark your branch as merged
4. Remove the worktree

---

## Backup Strategy

Feature branches are pushed to GitHub for backup without triggering releases (only `main` triggers releases). Use `git push origin <branch-name>` to back up.

| Branch | Local worktree | GitHub remote |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| `main` | `bristlenose/` | `origin/main` (push via `origin/main:wip` until release time) |
| `symbology` | `bristlenose_branch symbology/` | `origin/symbology` |
| `highlighter` | `bristlenose_branch highlighter/` | `origin/highlighter` |
| `living-fish` | `bristlenose_branch living-fish/` | `origin/living-fish` |

## Active Branches

### `highlighter` — started 13 Feb 2026

**Worktree:** `/Users/cassio/Code/bristlenose_branch highlighter`

**Goal:** Highlighter feature (TBD — to be detailed when scope is defined).

**Files likely to touch:**
- TBD

---

### `symbology` — started 12 Feb 2026

**Worktree:** `/Users/cassio/Code/bristlenose_branch symbology`

**Goal:** Add consistent Unicode prefix symbols (§ Section, ¶ Quote, ❋ Theme) across all user-facing surfaces — navigation, headings, dashboards, analysis, tooltips, and text output.

**Files likely to touch:**
- `bristlenose/stages/render_html.py` — dashboard stats, pane headings, template params
- `bristlenose/stages/render_output.py` — markdown heading call sites
- `bristlenose/theme/templates/toc.html` — TOC headings
- `bristlenose/theme/templates/global_nav.html` — tab labels
- `bristlenose/theme/templates/analysis.html` — analysis page headings
- `bristlenose/theme/js/analysis.js` — signal cards, heatmap headers
- `bristlenose/theme/js/transcript-annotations.js` — margin label tooltips
- `bristlenose/theme/js/codebook.js` — quote count tooltips

---

### `living-fish` — started 26 Feb 2026

**Status:** Just started
**Worktree:** `/Users/cassio/Code/bristlenose_branch living-fish/`
**Remote:** `origin/living-fish`

**What it does:** Animated "living portrait" bristlenose logo for serve mode. AI-generated video loop (WebM VP9 alpha + MOV HEVC alpha) with subtle breathing, gill pulsing, and fin movement — replacing the static PNG in serve mode only. Also fixes dark-mode logo by switching to a transparent-background PNG (eliminates `mix-blend-mode: lighten` hack and `<picture>` source-swapping).

**Files this branch will touch:**
- `bristlenose/server/app.py` — serve video assets as static files
- `bristlenose/theme/report_header.html` — `<video>` element in serve-mode branch
- `bristlenose/theme/atoms/logo.css` — video element styling, remove `mix-blend-mode` hack
- `bristlenose/theme/images/` — new assets (`.webm`, `.mov`, transparent `.png`)
- `frontend/src/` — React header component if logo is already a React island

**Potential conflicts with other branches:**
- `symbology` touches `render_html.py` and template headings — low risk (logo is separate from section symbols)
- `highlighter` — unknown scope, likely no overlap

## Completed Branches (for reference)

### `react-settings-about` — merged 25 Feb 2026

Settings panel and About panel migrated from vanilla JS to React islands (React migration steps 1 & 2). `SettingsPanel.tsx` and `AboutPanel.tsx` islands, QuotesStore module-level store with `useSyncExternalStore`, comment-marker injection in `render_html.py` and `app.py`.

### `split-badge` — merged 24 Feb 2026

Two-tone split speaker badges (Treatment E). Left half = speaker code in mono on badge-bg, right half = participant name in body font on quote-bg. Settings toggle (code+name / code-only). Em-dash removed from quote attribution. Always-on sticky transcript header with session selector. Serve mode: inline Jinja2 transcripts stripped, session links navigate to React transcript pages instead of vanilla JS drill-down.

### `context-expansion` — merged 24 Feb 2026

Quote context expansion on the quotes page. Hover over a quote's timecode to reveal chevron arrows (⌃/⌄); click to progressively disclose surrounding transcript segments inside the quote card. Speaker badge conditionally hidden when context segment is same speaker. New components: `ContextSegment`, `ExpandableTimecode`. CSS atom: `context-expansion.css`. Expansion state managed via reducer in `QuoteGroup`, transcript cache wired through `QuoteSections`/`QuoteThemes`.

Full pipeline integration: Python math module (`bristlenose/analysis/`), standalone `analysis.html` with injected JSON, client-side JS rendering. 97 tests across 4 files. Future phases in `docs/design-analysis-future.md`.


### `codebook-tag-filter` — merged 11 Feb 2026

Tag filter dropdown uses codebook colours and hierarchy. Tags grouped into tinted sections matching codebook page. Badge-styled labels via `createReadOnlyBadge()` in `badge-utils.js`. Search matches both tag names and group names.

### `navigation` — merged 11 Feb 2026

Global tab bar navigation for the HTML report. 7 tabs (Project, Sessions, Quotes, Codebook, Analysis, Settings, About). Sessions tab with grid → inline transcript drill-down. Project tab dashboard with stats, featured quotes, sections/themes tables, sentiment chart. Speaker cross-navigation from quote cards to session timecodes. Full ARIA/accessibility. `global-nav.js`, `global-nav.css`, `global_nav.html`, `session_table.html` added; `render_html.py` extended with ~800 lines; `main.js` boot refactored to `_bootFns` array.

## Coordination Notes for Claude Sessions

### Reading this file

Before making changes, run:
```bash
git fetch origin
cat docs/BRANCHES.md
```

### Conflict-prone files

These files are frequently edited by multiple features. Take extra care:

| File | Why it's hot |
|------|-------------|
| `bristlenose/stages/render_html.py` | All UI features touch this |
| `bristlenose/theme/js/main.js` | Boot sequence for all JS modules |
| `bristlenose/cli.py` | All new commands land here |
| `TODO.md` | Everyone updates it |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Everyone updates it |

### Safe editing patterns

1. **New files are safe** — if your feature adds a new module (`export.js`, `help-overlay.css`), no conflict risk
2. **Append-only changes are safe** — adding a new function to an existing file rarely conflicts
3. **Structural changes are risky** — refactoring existing code will conflict with parallel work

### When you encounter a conflict

1. Don't resolve it yourself — note it in the merge plan
2. Ask the user which version to keep
3. Or wait for the other branch to merge first, then rebase

### Communication pattern

If you need to signal something to a future Claude session:
1. Add a note to this file under your branch
2. Or create a `docs/notes-{branch-name}.md` for longer notes
3. Reference it in `CLAUDE.md` under "Reference docs"
