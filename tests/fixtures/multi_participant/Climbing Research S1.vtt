<v Sarah Chen>Thanks for joining me today. I'd love to hear about your climbing background. When did you first get into it?</v>

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:22.800
<v Tom Baker>Sure, yeah. I started maybe six years ago at a local indoor gym. A friend dragged me along and I was honestly terrible at first. Couldn't even finish a V1 boulder problem. But something about it just hooked me, you know? The problem-solving aspect, figuring out the sequence of moves.</v>

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.300
<v Sarah Chen>And what keeps you coming back? What's the main draw for you?</v>

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:45.600
<v Tom Baker>It's the combination of physical and mental challenge. Like, you can be really strong but if you don't read the route properly you're just going to burn out on the wall. I've seen big guys who can do fifty pull-ups flame out on problems that a twelve-year-old can cruise because they don't think about body position or balance.</v>

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Sarah Chen>That's interesting. Do you mostly climb indoors or have you moved outdoors?</v>

00:00:50.500 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Tom Baker>I started going outside about two years in. First trip was to Fontainebleau in France, which is this incredible sandstone bouldering area. The rock feels completely different from plastic holds. It's more textured, more organic. You have to trust tiny little edges and smears that look like nothing but actually hold your weight. That first trip completely changed how I think about climbing.</v>

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Sarah Chen>Can you tell me about your gear setup? What do you typically bring?</v>

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:36.400
<v Tom Baker>For bouldering it's pretty minimal. Shoes, chalk bag, a crash pad, maybe a brush to clean holds. The shoes are the biggest thing honestly. I went through about four pairs before I found ones that fit my foot shape properly. I've got wide feet so a lot of the popular aggressive shoes just destroy my toes. Right now I'm climbing in Scarpa Instincts which have been brilliant.</v>

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.100
<v Sarah Chen>What about when you're doing roped climbing? Does the gear list change much?</v>

00:01:41.000 --> 00:02:05.800
<v Tom Baker>Oh yeah, it's a completely different world. You need a harness, rope, quickdraws or trad gear depending on the style, a belay device, helmet for outdoor. When I started lead climbing I had to learn about clipping, building anchors, managing rope drag. There's this whole system of safety that you have to internalise until it becomes second nature. My partner and I run through a verbal checklist every single time before we leave the ground.</v>

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.400
<v Sarah Chen>Have you ever had a scary moment on the wall? How did you handle it?</v>

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:38.600
<v Tom Baker>Yeah, once at Stanage Edge in the Peak District. I was about fifteen metres up on a trad route and I placed what I thought was a solid cam, but when I weighted it testing the placement it shifted. My belayer caught me fine, only fell a couple of metres, but that moment of the gear moving under load was genuinely frightening. After that I became much more careful about testing placements and backing things up with redundancy.</v>

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.800
<v Sarah Chen>How has climbing affected other areas of your life, would you say?</v>

00:02:43.500 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Tom Baker>Massively. My fitness is the best it's ever been, but it's more than that. The risk assessment skills transfer everywhere. I'm calmer under pressure at work. I plan better. And the community is amazing. My closest friends now are all people I met at the climbing wall. There's something about trusting someone with your life on a rope that accelerates a friendship. We go on trips together, share beta, push each other.</v>

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Sarah Chen>Last question. Where's your dream climbing destination? Somewhere you haven't been yet?</v>

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:38.100
<v Tom Baker>Kalymnos in Greece. It's this limestone sport climbing paradise on a little island. Beautiful tufa formations, pockets, overhangs. The routes are supposed to be incredibly well bolted and the grade range means there's something for everyone. Plus you can swim in the Mediterranean between sessions and eat amazing food. A few friends went last autumn and the photos were just unreal. That's definitely next on my list.</v>

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.500
<v Sarah Chen>Brilliant, thank you so much Tom. That's been really insightful.</v>

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Tom Baker>No worries, it was fun to talk about.</v>
