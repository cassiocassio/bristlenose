00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.400
<v Sarah Chen>Great to have you both here. Let's start with introductions. Could each of you tell me how long you've been climbing?</v>

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:19.600
<v Priya Sharma>I've been climbing about three years now. Started at an indoor wall in Manchester when a colleague suggested it as a team building thing. I fell in love with it immediately. Now I go three or four times a week, sometimes more.</v>

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:33.500
<v Dan Okafor>For me it's been closer to ten years. I grew up near Snowdonia so I was scrambling on rocks as a kid before I even knew what climbing was formally. Got into sport climbing at university and then shifted more towards trad in the last five years.</v>

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Sarah Chen>Interesting range of experience. Priya, what grade are you climbing at currently?</v>

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:53.200
<v Priya Sharma>Indoors I'm comfortable on 6b, projecting 6c. Outdoors is a different story though. I've only been outside maybe eight or nine times and the grades feel so much harder. An outdoor 5 feels like an indoor 6a to me. The holds are less obvious and there's the whole fear factor of height with real rock beneath you.</v>

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.300
<v Sarah Chen>Dan, how does that compare to your experience of indoor versus outdoor grades?</v>

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:14.500
<v Dan Okafor>It's a common thing. The grade conversion is never exact because outdoor rock is so variable. A 6a on gritstone feels nothing like a 6a on limestone. I'd say there's always at least a grade or two of adjustment when you move outside. The mental game is honestly the bigger difference though. Indoors you know the fall is clean. Outside there are ledges, uneven ground, gear placements to worry about.</v>

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.600
<v Sarah Chen>Let's talk about footwork. How important is it relative to upper body strength?</v>

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:34.100
<v Priya Sharma>I think footwork is everything. When I first started I was pulling on holds with my arms and getting pumped after five minutes. My coach showed me that if you trust your feet and keep your weight over them, your arms barely need to work on lower grades. It was a revelation. I started sending routes I'd been stuck on for weeks.</v>

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Dan Okafor>Completely agree. I'd go further and say footwork is the single most important skill at every level. Watch any elite climber and their feet are doing eighty percent of the work. Precise placement, heel hooks, toe hooks, smearing. Adam Ondra on Silence, which is the hardest route in the world, his footwork is like a ballet dancer. It's extraordinary to watch.</v>

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.100
<v Sarah Chen>What about training? Do you follow any structured programme or is it more intuitive?</v>

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:17.200
<v Dan Okafor>I do a structured cycle. Three weeks building volume, one week deload. I hangboard twice a week for finger strength, campus board once for power, and then specific route climbing for technique. I also do antagonist exercises for shoulders and elbows because climbing creates muscle imbalances that can lead to injury if you don't address them.</v>

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:31.600
<v Priya Sharma>I'm much less structured. I mostly just climb and try hard things. I know I should probably hangboard but it's so boring compared to actually climbing. I do yoga twice a week which helps with flexibility and balance. And I run occasionally for general fitness but climbing is my main thing.</v>

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.500
<v Sarah Chen>How do you deal with fear or mental blocks on routes?</v>

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:52.800
<v Priya Sharma>I still struggle with this honestly. There's a roof problem at my gym that I can physically do every move on, but linking them together at height freaks me out. I've started doing breathing exercises before attempts. Counting to four on the inhale, holding for four, exhaling for four. It sounds simple but it genuinely helps calm my nervous system down.</v>

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:10.200
<v Dan Okafor>Fear is rational in climbing, it keeps you alive. The trick is distinguishing between useful fear and irrational fear. If I'm scared because the gear is sketchy, that's useful information. If I'm scared because the move looks big but the protection is solid, that's something to work through. I talk to myself on routes. Literally say out loud what I'm going to do next. It interrupts the panic spiral.</v>

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.400
<v Sarah Chen>Last thing. What's one piece of advice you'd give to a complete beginner?</v>

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:27.600
<v Dan Okafor>Climb with people who are better than you. Watch how they move, ask them questions, steal their beta. The climbing community is incredibly generous with knowledge. Nobody gatekeeps. Everyone remembers being a beginner and most people love sharing what they've learned.</v>

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Priya Sharma>I'd say don't compare yourself to anyone else. Everyone's body is different, everyone progresses at their own pace. I spent months feeling bad that I couldn't do a pull-up when other beginners could, but I had better flexibility so I could high-step onto holds they couldn't reach. Find what your body is good at and lean into that.</v>

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.200
<v Sarah Chen>Lovely. Thanks so much, both of you. Really appreciate your time.</v>

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Priya Sharma>Thank you!</v>

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.800
<v Dan Okafor>Cheers, that was great.</v>
