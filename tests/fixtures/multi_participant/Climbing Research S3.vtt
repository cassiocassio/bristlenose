<v Sarah Chen>Welcome, Alex. And just to let you know, my colleague Jamie is sitting in to observe today. They won't be asking questions but they're welcome to listen. Shall we dive in?</v>

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.600
<v Jamie Reeves>Hi Alex.</v>

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.400
<v Alex Drummond>Hey Jamie. Yeah, let's go for it.</v>

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Sarah Chen>So tell me about your route into climbing. How did it start for you?</v>

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:38.600
<v Alex Drummond>It was accidental really. I was backpacking in Thailand about four years ago and ended up at Railay Beach. There were these massive limestone cliffs right on the waterfront and people were just climbing them. I hired a guide for a half day and did my first ever multi-pitch. Three hundred feet above the ocean on this amazing orange rock. By the time I got to the top I knew this was going to be a big part of my life.</v>

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.800
<v Sarah Chen>That's quite the introduction. What happened when you got home?</v>

00:00:43.500 --> 00:01:03.200
<v Alex Drummond>I found the nearest climbing gym and signed up for a beginner course. Learned to belay, learned basic movement. Within a couple of months I was going four times a week. I progressed quite quickly because I had a gymnastics background as a teenager, so the body awareness and flexibility were already there. The finger strength took much longer though. That's the rate limiter for most people.</v>

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.400
<v Sarah Chen>Tell me about the social side. Do you climb with a regular group?</v>

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:28.800
<v Alex Drummond>Yes, I have a crew of about six people that I climb with regularly. We met at the gym and now we do outdoor trips together. We went to El Chorro in Spain last March which was incredible. The gorge there has hundreds of routes across every grade. We rented a house, cooked together, climbed all day. It was the perfect trip. The shared experience of pushing through something scary really bonds people.</v>

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.200
<v Sarah Chen>How do you handle the risk element? Does it worry you at all?</v>

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:55.600
<v Alex Drummond>I take risk management seriously. I've done a lead climbing course, a self-rescue course, and an outdoor first aid course. I check my gear before every session. I inspect knots. I never skip steps in the safety chain. But I think climbing is actually less risky than people assume because you have so much control over the variables. The danger is complacency, not the activity itself. When you start cutting corners is when accidents happen.</v>

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.500
<v Sarah Chen>What's been the hardest route you've completed?</v>

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:22.400
<v Alex Drummond>A 7a sport route at Portland in Dorset called Screaming Abdabs. It took me about twelve attempts over three visits. There's this one crux move where you have to lock off on a small crimp and throw dynamically to a jug above a slight overhang. My forearms would pump out every time before I could commit to the throw. I eventually sent it on a cool day in November when the friction was perfect and I just went for it without thinking.</v>

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Sarah Chen>That sounds incredible. Jamie, did you have anything you wanted to ask?</v>

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.900
<v Jamie Reeves>Just curious actually. Alex, do you use any apps or tech to track your climbing?</v>

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Alex Drummond>Yeah I use a couple of things. I log everything on a spreadsheet which is a bit old school. Date, location, route name, grade, whether I sent it or not, and notes on what went well or badly. I also film myself sometimes on hard problems to review my movement. You'd be amazed at what you can spot when you watch yourself back. Things like not fully extending your arm, or dropping your heel when you should be flagging.</v>

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.200
<v Sarah Chen>That's really methodical. Do many people in your group do that?</v>

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Alex Drummond>A couple do, but most people just climb and don't really analyse their sessions. I think the logging helps me progress faster because I can see patterns. Like I noticed from my spreadsheet that I struggle more on slab climbing than overhangs, so I've been deliberately picking slab routes to work on that weakness. Without the data I might not have noticed the imbalance.</v>

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Sarah Chen>Really useful insight. Thank you Alex, and thank you Jamie for joining us.</v>

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.400
<v Alex Drummond>Thanks, this was fun.</v>

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.200
<v Jamie Reeves>Thanks both.</v>
