<v Sarah Chen>Thanks for being here, Maya and Chris. My colleague Jamie is observing again today. Let's jump straight in. Maya, what's your climbing story?</v>

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:27.300
<v Maya Johal>I started about eighteen months ago. My partner is a climber and I'd always resisted going but they eventually convinced me. I expected to hate it but I had this moment on maybe my third visit where I topped out on a route that had felt impossible the week before. That sense of progression was addictive. Now I go more often than they do.</v>

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.800
<v Sarah Chen>Chris, how about you?</v>

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:47.200
<v Chris Park>I've been at it about seven years. I'm mainly a boulderer these days. I competed for a while at regional level but stepped back from competition because the training was taking the fun out of it. Now I just climb for the joy of it, chase projects outdoors, and coach a youth team on Wednesday evenings.</v>

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Sarah Chen>You coach as well? How does teaching affect your own climbing?</v>

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:09.800
<v Chris Park>It's made me a much better climber honestly. When you have to break down a movement and explain it to a ten-year-old, you understand it at a deeper level. I've improved my own technique by coaching others. And the kids are fearless. They'll try things that adults would overthink completely. Watching them has taught me to be bolder in my own climbing.</v>

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.300
<v Sarah Chen>Maya, what's been the steepest learning curve for you as a newer climber?</v>

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:32.600
<v Maya Johal>Trusting the rubber on my climbing shoes. The smearing technique where you just press your shoe flat against a smooth surface and it holds you through friction alone. It goes against every instinct. Your brain says there's nothing to stand on, but the rubber grips. I still have to consciously override that instinct every time. Chris has been helping me with it actually.</v>

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.100
<v Sarah Chen>Chris, what do you tell people about trusting their feet?</v>

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:52.400
<v Chris Park>I say start low. Stand on a smear six inches off the ground and feel how much it holds. Then do it at two feet. Then four. Build the evidence base in your body that the rubber works. Your conscious brain knows it works, the problem is your lizard brain doesn't believe it yet. You have to show it, not tell it. Repetition at safe height is the answer.</v>

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.800
<v Sarah Chen>What about injuries? Have either of you dealt with climbing injuries?</v>

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:14.300
<v Maya Johal>I strained a finger tendon about four months in. An A2 pulley in my ring finger. I was crimping too hard on holds that were too small for my level. I had to take six weeks off and it was awful. I was desperate to get back on the wall. The physio said it's the most common climbing injury and it almost always comes from doing too much too soon.</v>

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:33.700
<v Chris Park>Pulley injuries are an epidemic in climbing. I've had two. The second one taught me to take warm-ups seriously. Now I spend fifteen minutes on easy problems before I touch anything hard. I also tape my fingers preventatively on heavy crimping sessions. Prevention is so much better than rehab. Maya's right that it's usually a volume issue. People climb hard every day and their tendons can't keep up with their muscles.</v>

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.900
<v Sarah Chen>Jamie, was there anything from the injury discussion you wanted to follow up on?</v>

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.400
<v Jamie Reeves>Yeah actually. Do either of you use any recovery tools or routines?</v>

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:57.800
<v Chris Park>I do a rice bucket routine for my forearms and fingers. You literally bury your hands in a bucket of rice and do extension exercises. It strengthens the opposing muscles to the ones you use climbing. I also use a theraband for shoulder health. Takes ten minutes and it's the best injury prevention investment I've made.</v>

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:09.600
<v Maya Johal>I've started doing that too after Chris recommended it. I also foam roll my back and shoulders after sessions. And I make sure I eat protein within an hour of climbing. I read that tendon recovery is really dependent on nutrition and sleep quality.</v>

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.200
<v Sarah Chen>Fascinating. One last question for both of you. What's your goal for the next twelve months?</v>

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Maya Johal>I want to lead climb outdoors. I've only ever top-roped outside and I think leading is the next step. It scares me but in a good way. I've been practising lead falls indoors to build confidence with the bigger drops.</v>

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:42.800
<v Chris Park>I'm working towards a font 8A boulder outdoors. I have a specific problem in mind at Stanage. I've done all the individual moves but I haven't linked the whole thing yet. I think this spring when conditions are right I'll get it. It would be a milestone grade for me and it's been a goal for three years.</v>

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.200
<v Sarah Chen>Brilliant. Thank you both, and Jamie thanks for your questions.</v>

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.100
<v Maya Johal>Thanks Sarah!</v>

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Chris Park>Cheers.</v>

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.400
<v Jamie Reeves>Thanks everyone.</v>
