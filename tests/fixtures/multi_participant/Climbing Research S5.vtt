<v Sarah Chen>Thanks for coming in, Ren. I've got two observers with us today. Jamie from our research team and Nadia from product. They may have a question or two at the end. Sound okay?</v>

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.900
<v Ren Takahashi>Yeah, that's fine.</v>

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Jamie Reeves>Hi Ren.</v>

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.600
<v Nadia Costa>Hello.</v>

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.400
<v Sarah Chen>Let's start with the basics. How would you describe yourself as a climber?</v>

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:40.600
<v Ren Takahashi>I'd call myself an all-rounder. I boulder, sport climb, and I've been getting into trad over the last year. I'm probably strongest at bouldering because that's where I started, but I find longer routes more satisfying mentally. There's something about being on a wall for forty minutes managing energy and reading sequences that bouldering doesn't give you. The sustained problem-solving is what I love most.</v>

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.800
<v Sarah Chen>How do you pick which discipline to focus on in any given week?</v>

00:00:45.500 --> 00:01:04.200
<v Ren Takahashi>It depends on the season and my goals. In winter I mostly boulder indoors because the conditions are good and the days are short. Spring and autumn I'm outside on sport routes or trad. Summer is alpine season so if I'm lucky enough to get a trip to the Alps I'll train endurance leading up to it. I try not to train everything at once because you just end up mediocre at all of it.</v>

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.600
<v Sarah Chen>What's your training philosophy? How structured is your approach?</v>

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Ren Takahashi>I follow a loose periodisation. I'm not one of those people with a colour-coded spreadsheet, but I cycle through strength phases and endurance phases. Fingerboard training is the backbone of everything. Twenty minutes three times a week on a hangboard. I use the Lattice Training protocols which are evidence-based and well designed. Beyond that I climb a lot. Probably ten to twelve hours a week on the wall across four sessions.</v>

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.800
<v Sarah Chen>That's a serious commitment. How do you balance it with work and the rest of life?</v>

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:56.300
<v Ren Takahashi>I'm lucky that I work remotely so I can fit sessions in during the day when the gym is empty. I'll climb at lunchtime or in the afternoon and then work in the evening. It's not for everyone but it works for my schedule. The gym is five minutes from my flat which removes any friction. If I had to drive thirty minutes each way I probably wouldn't go as often. Proximity is everything for building habits.</v>

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.300
<v Sarah Chen>What's your experience with the climbing community? Is it welcoming?</v>

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:23.400
<v Ren Takahashi>Overwhelmingly yes. I moved to Sheffield two years ago specifically because of the climbing scene here. It's the UK capital for climbing really. The community is diverse, inclusive, helpful. People share beta freely, they'll spot you on boulders, they'll offer to belay strangers. I've met people from completely different backgrounds and professions who I'd never have crossed paths with otherwise. The wall is a great equaliser.</v>

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Sarah Chen>Has climbing changed how you think about fear or risk in general?</v>

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:52.100
<v Ren Takahashi>Definitely. Climbing teaches you that fear is information, not a command. You can feel scared and still act deliberately. That transfers to everything. Job interviews, difficult conversations, making big life decisions. I'm not saying climbing cured my anxiety, but it gave me a framework for operating under stress. You acknowledge the fear, you assess whether it's rational, and then you either proceed or back off. Both are valid choices.</v>

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.600
<v Sarah Chen>Jamie, Nadia, any questions for Ren?</v>

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Jamie Reeves>Ren, what's the one piece of gear you couldn't live without?</v>

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:13.200
<v Ren Takahashi>My chalk bucket. Not a chalk bag, a bucket. It sits on the ground when I'm bouldering and I can dip both hands in properly. It sounds trivial but dry hands make such a difference to confidence on hard moves. Good chalk application is underrated. I use loose chalk, not a ball, because I want full coverage.</v>

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.500
<v Nadia Costa>Do you use any digital tools for planning your sessions or tracking progress?</v>

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:35.400
<v Ren Takahashi>I use an app called Crimpd for my hangboard protocols. It has a timer and tells me when to hang and rest. For tracking climbs I use a simple notes app. I photograph the route, write down the grade and my notes, and that's it. I've tried dedicated climbing apps but they're all trying to be social networks and I just want a logbook. Nobody's nailed the simple version yet.</v>

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.200
<v Sarah Chen>Really helpful perspective. Thank you Ren, and thanks Jamie and Nadia.</v>

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Ren Takahashi>Thanks everyone, enjoyed it.</v>

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.500
<v Nadia Costa>Thank you.</v>

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.600
<v Jamie Reeves>Cheers.</v>
