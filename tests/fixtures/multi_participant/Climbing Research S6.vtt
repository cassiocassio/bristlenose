<v Sarah Chen>Thanks for joining us today, Liam. My colleague Marcus will be co-moderating. Marcus, do you want to kick us off?</v>

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.300
<v Marcus Webb>Sure. Liam, can you give us a quick overview of your climbing history?</v>

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:32.800
<v Liam O'Brien>Absolutely. I've been climbing for about twelve years now. Started as a teenager when my dad took me to an outdoor education centre in the Lake District. It was one of those taster sessions where you do a bit of everything. Abseiling, top-roping, bouldering. I was hooked from day one. By the time I was sixteen I was climbing three or four days a week and competing at junior level.</v>

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.200
<v Marcus Webb>Did you continue competing as an adult?</v>

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Liam O'Brien>I did for a few years. Made it to national level in bouldering but never quite broke into the international circuit. The top competitors are on another planet in terms of finger strength and power-to-weight ratio. I realised I was training so hard for competition that I'd stopped enjoying climbing. So I stepped back and refocused on outdoor climbing which is where my passion really lies.</v>

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.400
<v Sarah Chen>What's the outdoor trad scene like where you are?</v>

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:20.500
<v Liam O'Brien>I'm based in North Wales so I'm spoilt for choice. Gogarth for sea cliff trad, the Llanberis Pass for multi-pitch, Tremadoc for single pitch. The rock is mostly rhyolite and slate which gives fantastic friction when it's dry. The problem is it rains about three hundred days a year so you learn to climb on damp rock or you never climb at all. Welsh climbers are a hardy breed.</v>

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.800
<v Marcus Webb>How does trad climbing compare mentally to sport climbing for you?</v>

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:47.200
<v Liam O'Brien>Trad is a completely different mental game. In sport climbing the bolts are there, you clip them, the fall is predictable. In trad you're placing your own protection and your life depends on the quality of those placements. Every piece of gear is a decision. Is this crack the right size for a cam or a nut? How deep is the placement? Will it hold a fall? That ongoing decision-making under physical stress is what makes trad uniquely challenging.</v>

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Sarah Chen>Do you ever choose to go back to sport climbing just for the fun of easier mental load?</v>

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:08.300
<v Liam O'Brien>Oh totally. Sometimes I just want to pull hard on rock without thinking about gear. I'll go to a sport crag and just cruise laps on routes well below my limit. It's like how a runner might jog for enjoyment even though they can sprint. Not every session needs to be a mental battle. Sport climbing days are my rest days for the brain.</v>

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.200
<v Marcus Webb>Can you talk us through your rack? What gear do you carry on a typical trad route?</v>

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Liam O'Brien>A standard rack for me is a set of cams from point three to number three, which covers most cracks. A set of nuts from one to eleven. A few slings of different lengths, maybe six quickdraws as well because a lot of Welsh routes have the odd bolt between the trad placements. Two double-length slings for threads and spikes. A nut key for when placements get stuck. And then I'll customise based on the route description. If it says wide cracks I'll add bigger cams. If it's all thin seams I'll take extra small wires.</v>

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.600
<v Sarah Chen>That's a lot of metal. How heavy is that on your harness?</v>

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:58.800
<v Liam O'Brien>A full rack weighs maybe four or five kilos. You notice it on the walk in but once you're climbing you sort of forget about it. Racking efficiently is a skill though. You want everything in a logical order so you can grab the right piece without looking. Left side cams, right side nuts, back slings. Muscle memory is crucial when you're pumped and thirty metres up.</v>

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Marcus Webb>What's the proudest climbing achievement of your career so far?</v>

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Liam O'Brien>Completing a route called Indian Face on Clogwyn Du'r Arddu. It's an E9, which is the top end of the British trad grading system. The protection is extremely sparse and the consequences of a fall are serious. I spent an entire summer preparing for it. Rehearsing the moves on a top rope, visualising the sequences, building the specific strength I needed. When I finally led it clean it was the most intense thing I've ever experienced. I cried at the top.</v>

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.200
<v Sarah Chen>That's remarkable. Marcus, any final questions?</v>

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.100
<v Marcus Webb>Just one. Liam, what would you change about the climbing world if you could?</v>

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:52.600
<v Liam O'Brien>Access. In the UK we're lucky that most crags are on open access land, but there are still landowner disputes that close amazing climbing areas. And globally the situation is worse. Bolting bans, seasonal closures that aren't well communicated, private land issues. I'd love to see a unified global database of access information that climbers could contribute to. It's the biggest practical problem the sport faces.</v>

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.400
<v Sarah Chen>Thank you Liam. Really appreciate you sharing all of that with us.</v>

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.500
<v Marcus Webb>Yeah, fantastic insights. Thank you.</v>

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.300
<v Liam O'Brien>Thank you both, it's been a pleasure.</v>
