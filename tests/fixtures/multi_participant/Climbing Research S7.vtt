<v Sarah Chen>Thanks for coming in, all three of you. This is a bit of a group discussion so feel free to jump in on each other's points. Let's start with how you each got into climbing.</v>

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:22.100
<v Fatima Al-Rashid>I started two years ago after watching the Olympics. Seeing Janja Garnbret just dominate every discipline was inspiring. I thought if she makes it look that effortless there must be something to it. Joined my local wall the next week and I've been obsessed since.</v>

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:35.600
<v Ollie Stewart>Mine was a fitness thing originally. I was bored of the regular gym and wanted something more engaging. Climbing uses every muscle group and you don't even realise you're exercising because you're so focused on the puzzle. Four years later I'm in the best shape of my life and I never touch a treadmill.</v>

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:51.400
<v Kofi Mensah>I grew up in Ghana and we didn't have climbing gyms. I discovered it when I moved to London for uni. A flatmate took me and I was terrible but I loved the atmosphere. Everyone was encouraging. People I'd never met were shouting beta at me. That sense of community pulled me in more than the actual climbing at first.</v>

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.000
<v Sarah Chen>Kofi, you mentioned the community. How important is that social element for all of you?</v>

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:10.300
<v Kofi Mensah>For me it's essential. I wouldn't climb alone. The energy of other people trying hard around you raises your own game. When someone sends a project and the whole gym cheers, that collective excitement is contagious. I've been in corporate team building events that cost thousands and they don't build half the camaraderie of a bouldering session.</v>

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:22.500
<v Fatima Al-Rashid>I agree completely. I came for the climbing but I stayed for the people. My closest friends now are all from the wall. We do everything together, not just climbing. Dinners, hikes, holidays. The wall is just where the friendships started.</v>

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:34.800
<v Ollie Stewart>I'm a bit different actually. I mostly climb alone with headphones in. I find it meditative. But I appreciate the background social element. Knowing that if I fall someone will check on me, being able to ask for a spot on a high problem. The safety net of other people being around matters even if I'm not actively chatting.</v>

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.500
<v Sarah Chen>That's a really interesting range. What about outdoor climbing? Have you all been outside?</v>

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:54.700
<v Ollie Stewart>Yeah, I go to the Peak District most weekends when the weather's decent. Bouldering on gritstone is the best thing in the world. The friction is amazing when it's cold and dry. There's something about real rock that indoor climbing can't replicate. The texture, the imperfection, the natural movement it demands.</v>

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Fatima Al-Rashid>I've only been outside twice. Once to Portland and once to Fontainebleau. Fontainebleau changed my perspective completely. The problems are like sculptures. They've been polished by thousands of climbers over decades and each one has its own character and history. I want to go back as soon as possible.</v>

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:18.400
<v Kofi Mensah>I haven't been outside yet but it's on my list. I've been nervous about it because the grades feel so different from indoors. But Ollie has offered to take me to the Peak District next month and show me the basics. I'm excited and terrified in equal measure.</v>

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Sarah Chen>Ollie, any tips for taking someone outdoors for the first time?</v>

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:37.300
<v Ollie Stewart>Pick easy problems, bring plenty of crash pads, and don't push them. The first outdoor session should be about falling in love with the rock, not chasing grades. I'd take Kofi to Burbage which has loads of easy lines on beautiful gritstone with flat landings. Build confidence first, the hard stuff comes later.</v>

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Sarah Chen>Let's talk about what you'd change about the climbing experience, either gym or outdoor.</v>

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:56.200
<v Fatima Al-Rashid>Better changing facilities in gyms. This sounds mundane but most climbing walls have tiny changing rooms and barely any lockers. If you want to attract a wider demographic, especially women, you need to make the ancillary experience comfortable. The climbing is great but the facilities often feel like an afterthought.</v>

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:11.600
<v Kofi Mensah>Representation. When I look at climbing media it's overwhelmingly white. The actual climbing community at my gym is much more diverse than the magazines and social media suggest. I think if the media reflected reality better it would encourage more people from underrepresented backgrounds to try climbing. Seeing someone who looks like you doing something makes it feel possible.</v>

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Ollie Stewart>I'd want better route setting at gyms. A lot of places set for a narrow body type and climbing style. If you're tall everything feels scrunched. If you're short you can't reach half the holds. The best setters think about different body types and create problems that have multiple solutions for different morphologies. It shouldn't be a height competition.</v>

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.200
<v Sarah Chen>Those are all really strong points. Any final thoughts from anyone?</v>

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:43.500
<v Kofi Mensah>Just that climbing has genuinely changed my life. I came to London knowing nobody and now I have this incredible community. I'm fitter, more confident, more resilient. And I've visited places I'd never have gone otherwise because there happened to be good rock there. It opens up the world in unexpected ways.</v>

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:54.800
<v Fatima Al-Rashid>Same for me. It's given me a sense of agency that I didn't have before. When you stand at the bottom of something that looks impossible and then you climb it, that feeling transfers to everything else. Nothing at work scares me anymore after I've been twenty metres up a cliff.</v>

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:05.300
<v Ollie Stewart>I'll keep it brief. Climbing is the purest form of problem-solving I've ever found. You, the rock, gravity. No technology, no shortcuts. Just move your body up. I'll never stop doing it.</v>

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.800
<v Sarah Chen>Wonderful. Thank you all so much. This has been a really rich conversation.</v>

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.600
<v Fatima Al-Rashid>Thank you!</v>

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.100
<v Ollie Stewart>Cheers.</v>

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.600
<v Kofi Mensah>Thanks Sarah.</v>
