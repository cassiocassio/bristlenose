<v Sarah Chen>Thanks for joining me today. Can you tell me about your experience with the dashboard?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
<v Tom Baker>Sure. I found the dashboard pretty confusing at first. I couldn't figure out where my settings were.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
<v Sarah Chen>What specifically was confusing about it?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:38.000
<v Tom Baker>The navigation was hidden behind a hamburger menu. I kept looking for a sidebar but there wasn't one. Once I found it though, it made sense.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Sarah Chen>And how did you feel about the search feature?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.000
<v Tom Baker>Oh, the search was great actually. It was fast and the results were really relevant. That was probably the best part of the whole thing.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Sarah Chen>Good to hear. Any other thoughts on the overall experience?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:18.000
<v Tom Baker>I think the onboarding could be better. When I first signed up I had no idea what to do. A quick tutorial or walkthrough would have helped a lot.
